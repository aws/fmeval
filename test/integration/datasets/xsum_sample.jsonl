{"document":"Ferrari appeared in a position to challenge until the final laps, when the Mercedes stretched their legs to go half a second clear of the red cars.\nSebastian Vettel will start third ahead of team-mate Kimi Raikkonen.\nThe world champion subsequently escaped punishment for reversing in the pit lane, which could have seen him stripped of pole.\nBut stewards only handed Hamilton a reprimand, after governing body the FIA said \"no clear instruction was given on where he should park\".\nBelgian Stoffel Vandoorne out-qualified McLaren team-mate Jenson Button on his Formula 1 debut.\nVandoorne was 12th and Button 14th, complaining of a handling imbalance on his final lap but admitting the newcomer \"did a good job and I didn't\".\nMercedes were wary of Ferrari's pace before qualifying after Vettel and Raikkonen finished one-two in final practice, and their concerns appeared to be well founded as the red cars mixed it with the silver through most of qualifying.\nAfter the first runs, Rosberg was ahead, with Vettel and Raikkonen splitting him from Hamilton, who made a mistake at the final corner on his first lap.\nBut Hamilton saved his best for last, fastest in every sector of his final attempt, to beat Rosberg by just 0.077secs after the German had out-paced him throughout practice and in the first qualifying session.\nVettel rued a mistake at the final corner on his last lap, but the truth is that with the gap at 0.517secs to Hamilton there was nothing he could have done.\nThe gap suggests Mercedes are favourites for the race, even if Ferrari can be expected to push them.\nVettel said: \"Last year we were very strong in the race and I think we are in good shape for tomorrow. We will try to give them a hard time.\"\nVandoorne's preparations for his grand prix debut were far from ideal - he only found out he was racing on Thursday when FIA doctors declared Fernando Alonso unfit because of a broken rib sustained in his huge crash at the first race of the season in Australia two weeks ago.\nThe Belgian rookie had to fly overnight from Japan, where he had been testing in the Super Formula car he races there, and arrived in Bahrain only hours before first practice on Friday.\nHe also had a difficult final practice, missing all but the final quarter of the session because of a water leak.\nButton was quicker in the first qualifying session, but Vandoorne pipped him by 0.064secs when it mattered.\nThe 24-year-old said: \"I knew after yesterday I had quite similar pace to Jenson and I knew if I improved a little bit I could maybe challenge him and even out-qualify him and that is what has happened.\n\"Jenson is a very good benchmark for me because he is a world champion and he is well known to the team so I am very satisfied with the qualifying.\"\nButton, who was 0.5secs quicker than Vandoorne in the first session, complained of oversteer on his final run in the second: \"Q1 was what I was expecting. Q2 he did a good job and I didn't. Very, very good job. We knew how quick he was.\"\nThe controversial new elimination qualifying system was retained for this race despite teams voting at the first race in Australia to go back to the 2015 system.\nFIA president Jean Todt said earlier on Saturday that he \"felt it necessary to give new qualifying one more chance\", adding: \"We live in a world where there is too much over reaction.\"\nThe system worked on the basis of mixing up the grid a little - Force India's Sergio Perez ended up out of position in 18th place after the team miscalculated the timing of his final run, leaving him not enough time to complete it before the elimination clock timed him out.\nBut it will come in for more criticism as a result of lack of track action at the end of each session. There were three minutes at the end of the first session with no cars on the circuit, and the end of the second session was a similar damp squib.\nOnly one car - Nico Hulkenberg's Force India - was out on the track with six minutes to go. The two Williams cars did go out in the final three minutes but were already through to Q3 and so nothing was at stake.\nThe teams are meeting with Todt and F1 commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone on Sunday at noon local time to decide on what to do with qualifying for the rest of the season.\nTodt said he was \"optimistic\" they would be able to reach unanimous agreement on a change.\n\"We should listen to the people watching on TV,\" Rosberg said. \"If they are still unhappy, which I am sure they will be, we should change it.\"\nRed Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was fifth on the grid, ahead of the Williams cars of Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa and Force India's Nico Hulkenberg.\nRicciardo's team-mate Daniil Kvyat was eliminated during the second session - way below the team's expectation - and the Renault of Brit Jolyon Palmer only managed 19th fastest.\nGerman Mercedes protege Pascal Wehrlein managed an excellent 16th in the Manor car.\nBahrain GP qualifying results\nBahrain GP coverage details","summary":"Lewis Hamilton stormed to pole position at the Bahrain Grand Prix ahead of Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg.","id":"35951548"}

{"document":"That is the conclusion of a study by US biologists, exploring how the colour is created in different tarantula species.\nThe hue is caused by tiny structures inside the animals' hairs, but those shapes vary across the family tree.\nThis suggests, the researchers say, that the striking blue is not driven by sexual selection - unlike many other bright colours in the animal kingdom.\nThis argument is also supported by the fact that tarantulas have poor colour vision, and do not appear to show off their hairy blue body parts during courtship.\nNonetheless, Bor-Kai Hsiung and his colleagues found that 40 out of 53 groupings (genera) of tarantula exhibit a very vibrant blue.\n\"We collected published data and constructed a super-tree, which combined the previous published small trees,\" said Mr Hsiung, a PhD student at the University of Akron in Ohio and the first author of the study, published in Science Advances.\nThey then mapped blueness onto that evolutionary tree, based on a bank of tarantula snaps scoured from the internet.\n\"If the genus has at least one species that's blue, we say that's a blue genus,\" Mr Hsiung explained.\nGiven that scattering of blue species, he added, they then calculated \"the lowest number of changes that can produce a distribution of blue colouring like this\".\nThe answer? \"Eight is the lowest number, so it's [evolved] at least eight times.\"\nWhat is more, all these blue spiders evolved almost precisely the same shade; the wavelengths the team saw in the images all fell within a tight 20 nanometre range, clustered around 450nm - a bright, cobalt blue.\nThe team also purchased specimens of eight tarantula species, and took a close look at those blue hairs.\nThey used electron microscopes to zoom in on tiny shapes within the hairs and conducted simulations of how those shapes could produce a \"structural colour\" by reflecting - very specifically - this wavelength of blue light.\nThe results, again, pointed to the colour cropping up multiple times independently: several different types of shape could be seen, even on the same branch of the family tree.\n\"That's one of the reasons why it must have evolved so many times - because we don't see a very clear pattern of how these different mechanisms split,\" Mr Hsiung said.\n\"If we could see a clear split, then it might have evolved just one or two times. But it's all over the place.\"\nSo why did all these different species acquire the same colour?\nGiven their relatively simple eyes, it is doubtful that tarantulas can distinguish this shade of blue from any other colour.\nThat is one of the reasons that sexual selection seems unlikely - by contrast with some other spiders, which have remarkably good vision and put on very colourful courtship displays, such as the mesmerising peacock spider.\n\"It evolved from multiple origins and different mechanisms produce the very same blue colour,\" Mr Hsiung said. \"That's very strong evidence to suggest that this blue colour has a very important visual signalling function.\n\"But if it's not for other tarantulas, then it must be to some other receivers out there.\"\nIt may be that this colour helps conceal the critters from their prey while they hunt at night; or perhaps it serves as a warning to stop the tarantulas themselves being eaten.\n\"We don't know yet,\" Mr Hsiung said.\nFollow Jonathan on Twitter","summary":"Tarantulas have evolved almost exactly the same shade of vibrant blue at least eight separate times.","id":"34944735"}

{"document":"Mr Fox, 54, from London, denies eight counts of indecent assault and two counts of sexual assault between 1988 and 2014.\nHe said there was often \"horseplay\" with colleagues, involving \"piggybacks, tickling and squeezing\".\nBut he told Westminster Magistrates' Court such behaviour was consensual.\nMr Fox, who uses the nicknames Dr Fox and Foxy, became well known for presenting the chart show on Capital Radio, and was a judge on the ITV show Pop Idol between 2001 and 2003 alongside Simon Cowell.\nHe joined Magic 105.4 in 2005, where he presents the breakfast show, Foxy in the Morning. He is currently not hosting the show.\nGiving evidence on Wednesday, Mr Fox said he had worked with \"hundreds\" of female colleagues during his career, but had never been accused of sexually inappropriate behaviour until last year.\nUnder questioning from his defence counsel, Jonathan Caplan QC, he told the court his teams had kept their energy up during live broadcasts by playing loud music, dancing and creating makeshift obstacle courses.\n\"It sounds daft, but it was the way we, I, got myself going, and the team would join in very much as well. They would be part of that.\"\nHe said his entire shifts, not just the on-air periods, constituted a \"full performance\" and colleagues would often make playful comments to one another.\nMr Caplan asked: \"Could those comments become edgy or sexual?\"\nMr Fox replied: \"Of course they could.

Some of it could be saucy, cheeky, over-the-top.\"\nReferring to the \"horseplay\" in the office, Mr Fox insisted he would never have engaged in such conduct if it was not consensual, \"otherwise it would create a bad atmosphere in the studio\".\nAsked whether the culture of radio had changed during the past 25 years, he said: \"I think the workplace in general, it's changed, hasn't it?\n\"Laws have changed. HR has changed. Political correctness has changed.\"\nHe added: \"But I don't think my behaviour has changed.

{"document":"He would go upstairs, on the premise that he was saying a prayer with his niece, then sexually abuse her.\nNow in her 30s, Karen wasn't understood when she first told her parents what her uncle, Mark Sewell, was doing.\nSewell was also the son of a trusted older member of the local Jehovah's Witnesses congregation, known as an elder.\nChristian churches, as well as other religions, have faced claims of child abuse.\nBut what is striking about the Jehovah's Witnesses is their explicit policy of dealing with abuse in-house.\nBecause of their practice of following the Bible literally, they insist there must be two witnesses to a crime, often not the case in child abuse cases.\nHowever, in Karen's case a second witness did come forward: Wendy, a family friend and fellow member of the Barry congregation in south Wales. She had been raped by the same man.\nWhen she reported the crime to elders, Wendy was made to describe it in minute detail to a group of older men.\nLater, she had to give her account again in the same room as Sewell.\nAfterwards, the elders told her that as it was only her account against that of Sewell, nothing more could be done.\nThis bringing together of the accused and the accuser in a \"judicial committee\" is a common feature of Jehovah's Witnesses' justice.\nKaren, still a teenager at the time, was put through the process.\nThe elders also ruled that their separate accusations didn't constitute the required two witnesses.\nDespite a pattern of predatory sexual behaviour, it took more than two decades to bring Wendy and Karen's abuser to justice.\nHe is now serving a 14-year prison sentence.\nHis punishment from the Jehovah's Witnesses? There wasn't one.\nEven when the case came to court, the organisation was reluctant to co-operate.\nKaren's father, John Viney, who was also an elder in the Barry congregation, says that elders who knew of Sewell's conduct and were asked to give statements or evidence in court did not want to get involved.\nIn a programme for Radio 4's The Report, we have identified this lack of co-operation in several other similar cases.\nConfidential documents from the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of Britain - the official name for the Jehovah's Witnesses - that we have seen are explicit about the best way to deal with such matters being within the congregation.\nNowhere in the hundreds of pages we have seen are elders told that they must go to the police, even if the perpetrator confesses, unless state or national law makes it mandatory to report such allegations.\nThe Jehovah's Witnesses' UK leadership declined to talk to us for the programme.\nIn a statement, they said they were appealing against a recent High Court ruling in the UK that awarded substantial damages against the organisation for failing to protect a child from sexual abuse by a paedophile.\nTheir statement also insists that the organisation does take child abuse extremely seriously.\nKaren Morgan and Wendy are now pursuing a civil claim against the organisation, hoping that further financial penalty may force the leadership of the Jehovah's Witnesses to change its policies.\nFor both of them, what made it even harder was the sense that belonging to the Jehovah's Witnesses was part of an all-encompassing lifestyle, with members encouraged to socialise and marry within the group.\nThe organisation has some eight million members around the world, but as Karen found to her cost, those who decide to have a boyfriend or girlfriend who is not a member may find themselves \"disfellowshipped\" or shunned.\nJehovah's Witnesses are not the only religious organisation to try to deal with allegations of sexual abuse in-house.\nFor many decades, that was the preferred method of the Roman Catholic Church, which has since reformed its child safeguarding policies following numerous court cases in the US and Europe against priests for the sexual abuse of children.\nOther churches have also tightened up their child safeguarding policies, with the Methodist Church conducting its own recent inquiry into abuse allegations dating back to 1950.\nThat inquiry has led to calls for the Church of England to hold a fresh internal inquiry of its own, separately from the overarching national public inquiry that has just begun, and from the investigation it published in 2010, which critics termed inadequate.\nHowever, it is the more closed religious communities and new religious movements where it remains hardest for the victims of such abuse to speak out and gain access to secular justice, although awareness of the issue is growing.\nOnly this month, an ultra-Orthodox Jewish scholar from Manchester - who fled to Israel after he was exposed as a paedophile - was jailed for 13 years.\nTodros Grynhaus was deported by the Israeli authorities to face justice in the UK, with his conviction for sex offences against girls leading to a change in attitudes in the Haredi Jewish community.\nThe case prompted the UK's Chief Rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, to urge members to report child sex abuse.\nThe court had heard that both women who testified against Grynhaus in the case had been \"ostracised\" by their community as a result of speaking out about their ordeal.\nFor young Muslim girls, the price of speaking out about child sexual abuse can also be high, with many reluctant to report such abuse because of the fear that it would bring shame on them and their family.\nSexual and physical abuse at Islamic religious schools, known as madrassas, has also resulted in some prosecutions in recent years, although often victims still hesitate to come forward with such allegations.\nMany religious organisations will find themselves being closely scrutinised in the national independent inquiry into child sexual abuse,  chaired by New Zealand judge Lowell Goddard.\nThe survivors of such abuse hope that the inquiry will prove itself truly independent, and help ensure that abusers will not be able to rely on their own congregations or religious leaders to protect them - whatever their faith.\nThe Inquiry will investigate a wide range of institutions including:\nLocal authorities\nThe police\nThe Crown Prosecution Service\nThe Immigration Service\nThe BBC\nThe armed forces\nSchools\nHospitals\nChildren's homes\nChurches, mosques and other religious organisations\nCharities and voluntary organisations\nFull details of the inquiry\nCaroline Wyatt's investigation will be broadcast in Radio 4's The Report at 20:00 BST on Thursday, 23 July.","summary":"From when Karen Morgan was 12, until she was well into her teens, she was sexually abused by her uncle -

The Commons vote is due at 19:00 GMT.\nThe House of Commons is debating the Welfare Benefits Uprating Bill, which would keep benefit rises to 1% for three years from next April.\nThe coalition argues this is necessary to reduce the deficit, and is fair at a time when public sector pay is being capped and salaries in the private sector are rising below the rate of inflation.\nBut Labour, which opposes the cap, says it will result in a real-terms cut in support for millions of working people.\nSome Lib Dem MPs, including David Ward, John Leech, Julian Huppert and former minister Sarah Teather, are expected to rebel against the government while others - including Julian Huppert - could abstain.\nMr Leech, MP for Manchester Withington, said he found it \"objectionable that the Tories are using 'skivers versus strivers' rhetoric to justify a cut to seven million working families\".\nDespite the concerns of some Lib Dems, the coalition is thought likely to win the vote.\nLegislation is needed to implement changes announced by Chancellor George Osborne in last month's Autumn Statement - to cap increases in jobseeker's allowance, employment and support allowance, income support and elements of housing benefit.\nThe cap would also apply to maternity allowance, sick pay, maternity pay and paternity pay as well as the couple and lone parent elements of the working tax credit and the child element of the child tax credit.\nThese benefits traditionally rise in line with consumer prices in an annual process known as \"uprating\".\nBy Ross HawkinsPolitical correspondent, BBC News\nGlance at the spreadsheets and the scale of the saving is apparent.\nFigures in the Autumn Statement show raising many benefits and tax credits by 1% a year will save \u00a32.8bn in 2015\/16, compared with the government's previous plans.\nThe overall welfare budget in 2011\/12, as calculated by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, is \u00a3201bn.\nThe political debate will centre on who should feel the pain.\nJobseekers Allowance totals 2.4% of the total bill, according to the IFS. Benefits for those on low incomes make up just under 21%.\nThose for elderly people, including the state pension, make up over 42%.\nThe estimated value of fraud and error overpayments in benefit expenditure in 2011-12 is \u00a33.2 billion.\nThey increased 5.2% this year and without the planned change would have been set to rise by 2.2% - the rate of CPI inflation last September, on which the figure is calculated. The rate of inflation has since risen to 2.7%.\nDuring lively scenes in Parliament, Mr Duncan Smith said: \"The number one priority now is reducing the deficit that they [Labour] left us - the biggest deficit since the Second World War.\"\nHe added that the gap between the rate of income inflation between workers and the unemployed had \"grown\" in the last few years.\n\"These are decisions that we are not taking easily but these are circumstances that they [Labour] are in denial about,\" Mr Duncan Smith said.\nFor Labour, shadow work and pensions secretary Liam Byrne accused the government of presiding over an increase in unemployment.\nBut Mr Duncan Smith said this was not the case and that the US and other European countries were faring worse than the UK.\nMr Byrne said the government was showing \"contempt\" by trying to \"ram this bill through the House in just one day\".\nHe added: \"It's turning into a hit-and-run on working families and we should not stand for it.\"\nGreen Party MP Caroline Lucas said: \"Isn't the truth of this that it's a mean and miserable piece of legislation from a mean and miserable government?\"\nSarah Teather, who was replaced as an education minister in last autumn's government reshuffle, said she would oppose the bill \"with a heavy heart\" because it was \"disingenuous\" to try to \"find someone to blame for our own woes\".\n\"A fissure already exists between the working and non-working poor,\" she told MPs. \"Hammering on that fault line with the language of 'shirkers and strivers' will have long-term impacts on public attitudes, on attitudes of one neighbour against another.\n\"It will make society less generous, less sympathetic, less able to co-operate.\"\nHowever, Lib Dem deputy leader Simon Hughes told the House: \"It's difficult but the government has got the right and I believe, after this parliament, it will be vindicated by getting more people in work and fewer out of work.\"\nDavid Cameron's official spokesman said: \"The prime minister's view is that the welfare system has to be brought back under control.

{"document":"Nicola Sturgeon told MSPs a target to reduce six week delays in discharging patients had been delivered.\nBut Labour said it had not been met for more than three years, and called for her to amend the record.\nMs Sturgeon's office said she would not be revising her remarks because the six-week target had been met in the past.\nDelayed discharge - sometimes referred to as bed blocking - is when a patient is not released from hospital despite being clinically well enough to be discharged, often because of a lack of care of care services.\nMs Sturgeon faced criticism over the issue during first minister's questions in the Scottish Parliament, with Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale saying that people had remained in hospital for a total of 612,000 days last year when they were well enough to go home.\nShe said Ms Sturgeon had told the SNP conference in 2011 that patients spent 200,000 days in a hospital bed when they did not need to.\nMs Dugdale added: \"That means it has more than trebled under the SNP government since this first minister admitted there was something badly wrong. So, by any measure that is unacceptable.\n\"That is thousands of patients, the majority of whom are elderly, ready to go back home or into the community but can't because the extra support they need just isn't there.\"\nShe also claimed that delayed discharge got worse during the peak of summer despite Health Secretary Shona Robison saying in February that she wanted to \"completely eradicate\" the problem.\nThe substance is this. In the middle of a flood of stats, Ms Sturgeon said: \"Having delivered the target of zero delays over six weeks, we have progressively toughened that target.\"\nA delay of that duration, for the avoidance of doubt, involves a patient being kept in hospital for at least six weeks longer than clinically necessary, generally because no alternative care is available.\nDr Simpson said he had checked with parliament's own information centre. Based on that research, allied to his own knowledge, he believed the First Minister's remarks were misleading.\nAccording to Labour, Scotland's patients had not enjoyed \"zero delays over six weeks\" for three years. That is, there had been patients during that three-year period who had stayed more than six weeks in hospital beyond potential discharge.\nThe immediate response from the First Minister's office is that the target - of zero delays over six weeks - had been met in the past. The general tenor of her remarks was that matters were improving - while there remained more to be done.\nDr Simpson has now, in effect, suggested that Ms Sturgeon might reconsider that stance.\nRead more from Brian\nMs Sturgeon responded by acknowledging that there was still work to do, but said \"real progress\" was being made.\nShe later added: \"Since 2007 there's been a 52% reduction in delays over four weeks, a 55% reduction in delays over six weeks, the number of delays over three days is down by 50%, the number of delays over four weeks has been reduced as well.\n\"Having delivered the target of zero delays over six weeks, we've progressively toughened that target and we're now focusing on ensuring patients are discharged within 72 hours.\"\nThat comment drew an angry response from Labour MSP Dr Richard Simpson, who subsequently made a formal point of order to the presiding officer.\nDr Simpson said that the six-week target had been missed in every month since 2012.\nHe also said that official statistics showed that more than 4,700 patients had been delayed more than six weeks despite being fit to leave since 2012, and nearly 400 in the past two months alone.\nDr Simpson added: \"We all know that nationalist rhetoric is divorced from reality but this is completely unacceptable.  It was completely wrong to claim that these targets had been met when in reality thousands of patients had waited in hospital beds.\n\"Our NHS is in real trouble. The health minister pledged to abolish delayed discharge by the end of the year. Instead it is going in the wrong direction. Meanwhile we see the first minister is making completely false claims about her government's record.\n\"Patients and staff don't benefit from bogus claims about NHS performance. The first minister should correct the record, and this SNP government should get a grip of delayed discharge rather than bury their heads in the sand.\"\nBut a Scottish government spokeswoman said: \"The first minister was correct that the old six week target was met, on a number of occasions, under this government.\n\"Subsequently, the Scottish government introduced new tougher targets that no patient should wait more than four weeks, and later two weeks, from when they are clinically ready for discharge.\n\"Working with our partners in local government we've made the level of performance we expect tougher still, with an ambition for patients to be delayed for no more than 72 hours.\"","summary":"Labour has accused the Scottish first minister of misleading parliament over hospital bed blocking statistics.","id":"34352262"}

It had to be political for me, rather than my credentials.\n\"Maybe my external look isn't to everybody's liking. It was the right time and the right job for me but not from the FA's point of view.\n\"It seems foreign coaches are still all the craze for the top jobs and that is a great shame. I also think that Steve not being successful was a massive blow for British or English managers, because it has put us down a peg or two.\"\n2015\nFrom his autobiography:\n\"I wanted to do a real knock-your-socks-off interview for the FA, so I put together a PowerPoint which looked at every single detail.\n\"Nobody but nobody was going to beat it. But then Brian Barwick, the chief executive, told me there were no PowerPoint facilities at the interview venue, so I had to print off hard copies for the panel. So much for the progressive FA.\n\"I should have got it and, as I'm a better manager now than I was then, I believe I should be in the running whenever it comes round again. That's not vanity or being full of my own importance. My track record entitles me to be considered.\"\nMay 2016\nPrior to Euro 2016:\n\"That's gone.

{"document":"If he does become the next Premier League manager to lose his job, it would not just be unfair, it would be absolutely ridiculous.\nI cleaned Tim's boots when I was an apprentice at Norwich in the late 1980s, and he was the captain at Blackburn Rovers when we won the Premier League together in 1995.\nOf course I am not just backing him to succeed at Villa because I used to play with him - the reason is that, since the earliest days of my career, I have always seen him as manager material.\nWhen I was a teenager I looked up to him because I liked the way he went about things and how he dealt with me and other people. Even though he was a young man then too, the other players all thought the same.\nCharacter is a bit of a buzzword these days, but as a player I looked around for team-mates who had the ability to handle pressure and Tim was always one of them.\nAt 46, he is a relatively young manager now, certainly in terms of experience, but you have to remember he was quite a young captain at Blackburn too - he was 26 when we were champions.\nWe had some pretty big-hitters in terms of personalities in that dressing room, the likes of Alan Shearer, David Batty, Tim Flowers and Colin Hendry.\nThey were never afraid to have their say but, if you speak to them, they will all tell you they admired Tim not just for what he brought to the team as a player but also his contribution to the club's success as captain.\nFor Tim to be skipper ahead of, say, Shearer shows you what the Blackburn boss Kenny Dalglish thought of him too.\nHe always had the leadership qualities you need as a manager and, on top of that, I always thought he was extremely knowledgeable about the game.\nHe comes across as confident or even cocky in some respects, but in the dressing room it doesn't matter whether you are an introvert or an extrovert as long as what you are saying makes sense. Tim always did.\nSo it does not surprise me that, as a manager, he has got the best out of players who had been under-performing - like Emmanuel Adebayor at Spurs or Christian Benteke and Fabian Delph at Villa last season - because he has always had the ability to get people playing for him.\nAt times he might say things that players don't like - because he tells the truth. That ruffles a few feathers but I don't mind it, in fact he should be commended for it.\nThese days I hear a lot of people in football say things with no substance behind them, but Tim certainly is not like that - he can always back his opinions up.\nTim earned his right to have a proper crack at being Villa boss with the incredible job he did to keep them up after taking charge in February, when they were in desperate trouble with a dreadful scoring record.\nVilla have been fighting relegation for a few years now under several different managers so this season was never going to be any different.\nBut, just eight games into the new campaign and at the first sign of adversity, Sherwood already appears to be under massive pressure.\nYou have to take into consideration that he lost his two best players over the summer in striker Benteke and midfielder Delph, who were both inspirational for him last season, and realise he is trying to build a new team with all the signings that Villa have made.\nVilla's net spend over the summer was under \u00a310m - and a lot of that went on young players with little or no Premier League experience.\nThey have plenty of potential, and also plenty of sell-on value which seems to be a big part of the club's thinking, but it is a gamble whether they work out for Villa now and that is Sherwood's problem.\nI don't know who had the final say on each deal but from what I understand, Villa's head of recruitment Paddy Reilly and sporting director Hendrik Almstadt play a big part in the process.\nYou cannot blame Tim for the squad not being strong enough if it is not just down to him, but he is the one who is being criticised because Villa have not won since the opening day.\nI get why the club's owner Randy Lerner might be getting twitchy because of the amount of money at stake if they go down, but the logical thing to do is to give Sherwood more time because he is an intelligent man who has already shown he can improve players - which is exactly what Villa need now.\nSherwood has chopped and changed his team and formation a lot so far, but that is only because he is trying to find the right balance between attack and defence while he beds those new signings in and finds a system that works with the players he has got.\nThe choices he has to make with his current forwards is an example of how difficult that is.\nLike Benteke, Rudy Gestede has tremendous physical attributes and is as good as there is in the air in the Premier League.\nIn an effort to make the most of that, Sherwood has tried to get his full-backs forward to get crosses into the box - Jordan Amavi and Alan Hutton or Leandro Bacuna have all done that far more than any of Villa's midfielders.\nBut what Gestede doesn't have is the ability to link up play, or the pace to get behind defences. In that way, Benteke was much more of an all-round striker.\nSherwood can leave out Gestede and play Gabriel Agbonlahor or Jordan Ayew if he wants pace, but then he does not have that same physical presence up front, or any aerial threat.\nWhoever he picks, he is missing something that Benteke provided on his own.\nBecause he is trying to find that balance between attack and defence, he cannot always play two up front to solve that problem, especially because he is also trying to fit Jack Grealish into his team as an attacking midfielder.\nGrealish is a young player who has a lot of talent but picking him creates a different issue because winning games is not just down to what happens when you have got the ball.\nHowever good Grealish is going forward, he does not always put in a shift going back the other way.\nWhen you lose possession, you need to be compact and tight defensively and Villa have lacked that in the games I have seen, notably in their defeat by Leicester when they were hit on the counter-attack time and time again.\nYou really need defensive responsibility when you are in Villa's position near the bottom of the table.\nThat might be one of the reasons why Sherwood has apparently used this international break to try to get Grealish fitter.\nAfter trying so many formations and line-ups, maybe we will see Sherwood sticking with just one in the next five or six games.\nA settled system and some continuity is what Villa need at the moment. Tim knows that and, if he is given the chance, I am confident he will get it right.\nChris Sutton was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.","summary":"There is a lot of talk that Tim Sherwood is close to being sacked by Aston Villa but I cannot understand why they would even contemplate getting rid of him at this stage of the season.","id":"34541803"}

{"document":"The title pacesetters would always be able to recover from a bad result - but how would they cope with the exclusion of their firebrand top scorer after a training ground bust-up and suggestions of interest from China?\nChelsea gave their answer with an impressive 3-0 win at Leicester City that, combined with the weekend's other results, put them firmly back in control of their Premier League destiny.\nSo, after 21 games and another weekend of significant matches, how are the top six clubs shaping up?\nForm: Won 14 out of past 15.\nUpcoming fixtures: 22 January - Hull (home), 31 January - Liverpool (away), 4 February - Arsenal (home).\nConte will have demanded an instant Premier League response from his team after that 2-0 loss at White Hart Lane, which he rightly placed in context by pointing out it was inflicted by a quality side with title aspirations of their own.\nThe wildcard was provided by the sudden falling out with influential striker Costa that provided an unexpected backdrop to Saturday's events at the King Power Stadium and gave the first hint of dissent in Chelsea and Conte's camp this season.\nIn the end, the Italian boss was given the opportunity to prove the versatility and flexibility of his squad in Costa's absence as Willian, Eden Hazard and Pedro provided the attacking threat.\nIn the absence of any suggestion Blues owner Roman Abramovich will bow to pressure to sell in January, the priority now is to get the combustible Spain striker back on side and ensure any unrest does not spread.\nIf that can be done, then Chelsea can look back at a weekend where their title position was strengthened as they now stand seven points clear.\nVerdict: Back on track and clear title favourites.\nForm: Won past six.\nUpcoming fixtures: 21 January - Manchester City (away), 31 January - Sunderland (away), 4 February - Middlesbrough (home).\nMauricio Pochettino's side are a growing force in this title race and the 4-0 demolition of West Bromwich Albion was further evidence of their growing authority.\nIt was their sixth straight league win since their loss at Manchester United in December - and they have only lost two games out of 21.\nHarry Kane is firing on all cylinders, shown by his hat-trick against West Brom, and with Dele Alli scoring seven goals in his past five league games Spurs are starting to look the full package.\nThey ran out of steam towards the end of last season, but Pochettino is a top-class operator who will surely have learned his lesson and tailored his team's intense style accordingly.\nThe Argentine will still hope to avoid injuries and there is a real worry over influential defender Jan Vertonghen, who Pochettino fears has suffered a \"bad\" ankle injury.\nNext weekend's game at Manchester City will tell us even more about them.\nVerdict: Flew under the radar for a while but now right at the heart of the title race.\nForm: One defeat in past 19.\nUpcoming fixtures: 21 January - Swansea (home), 31 January - Chelsea (home), 4 February - Hull (away).\nLiverpool will be disappointed they could not hold on for victory at Manchester United on Sunday, but there is plenty of encouragement to take from their performance.\nThe disappointment will come because they were within six minutes of securing a win that would not only have inflicted even more damage on United, but also would have sent a strong message to those nearer the top of the table.\nIt is to the Reds' credit that they came so close to victory despite key men such as Philippe Coutinho still not fit enough to start, Nathaniel Clyne out with a rib injury and Joel Matip sidelined because of confusion surrounding his absence from Cameroon's Africa Cup Of Nations squad.\nManager Jurgen Klopp rightly believes they are still in a strong position but will surely be frustrated that Zlatan Ibrahimovic's late goal means Chelsea stretched their advantage to seven points.\nVerdict: Remain title contenders but top four would still be fine achievement.\nForm: Unbeaten in past four.\nUpcoming fixtures: 22 January - Burnley (home), 31 January - Watford (home), 4 February - Chelsea (away).\nArsenal's win at Swansea City could not have been more convincing and they have responded well to successive losses at Everton and Manchester City, when they conceded winning positions and showed the vulnerability that has haunted them for seasons.\nEven at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday they made a slow start, but it is hard to argue with a 4-0 away win.\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger wants the Gunners to stay in the title shake-up until the closing stages - and they are certainly doing that so far.\nAre they, however, potential Premier League winners? They cannot be ruled out but it is hard to see where they will pick up the points to haul in Chelsea.\nVerdict: In the mix as their manager demands, but will a soft centre let them down?\nForm: Two defeats in past three.\nUpcoming fixtures: 21 January - Tottenham (home), 1 February - West Ham (away), 5 February - Swansea (home).\nManager Pep Guardiola effectively wrote off Manchester City's title challenge after they were giving a thorough working over and beaten 4-0 at Everton.\nCity now face a fight to finish in the top four with a side seemingly physically weak, riddled with defensive frailty and a goalkeeper in Claudio Bravo who hardly ever seems to save a shot. Failure to make next season's Champions League would represent a catastrophe in the Spaniard's first season.\nAnd this is Guardiola's responsibility after he shipped out England keeper Joe Hart on loan to Torino. Out of the past 22 shots Bravo has faced, 14 have been goals.\nOnly five teams have a lower haul than City's tally of four clean sheets and they have conceded from the first shot they have faced in four of their past seven games.\nThe problems are there for all to see, although Guardiola has so far done little to correct the faults.\nCity have suffered two damaging defeats on Merseyside in recent weeks - and do not look like a side who have the slightest chance of making up a 10-point deficit on Chelsea.\nVerdict: Forget the title. Manchester City are in a top-four fight now.\nForm: Unbeaten in past 12.\nUpcoming fixtures: 21 January - Stoke (away), 1 February - Hull (home), 5 February - Leicester (away).\nManchester United are showing definite signs of improvement under manager Jose Mourinho, but like neighbours City their fight is now for the top four rather than the title.\nThey could have closed to within two points of Liverpool with victory at Old Trafford on Sunday, but 12 points is surely an impossible gap to breach between United and Chelsea.\nUnited have drawn seven league games - including five at home - and the simple fact is they have squandered too many points to make up the deficit.\nMourinho is definitely moving United forward, but not fast enough to make them title contenders this season.\nVerdict: Top four should be the target.

{"document":"They also provide the first direct evidence that there may be as much water trapped in those rocks as there is in all the oceans.\nThe diamond, from central-west Brazil, contains minerals that formed as deep as 600km down and that have significant amounts of water trapped within them.\nResearchers have published their findings in the journal Nature.\nThe study suggests water may be stored deep in the interiors of many rocky planets.\nDiamonds, brought to the Earth's surface in violent eruptions of deep volcanic rocks called kimberlites, provide a tantalising window into the deep Earth.\nA research team led by Prof Graham Pearson of the University of Alberta, Canada, studied a diamond from a 100-million-year-old kimberlite found in Juina, Brazil, as part of a wider project.\nThey noticed that it contained a mineral, ringwoodite, that is only thought to form between 410km and 660km beneath the Earth's surface, showing just how deep some diamonds originate.\nWhile ringwoodite has previously been found in meteorites, this is the first time a terrestrial ringwoodite has been seen. But more extraordinarily, the researchers found that the mineral contains about 1% water.\nWhile this sounds like very little, because ringwoodite makes up almost all of this immense portion of the deep Earth, it adds up to a huge amount of deep water.\nDr Sally Gibson from the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the work, commented: \"Finding water in such large concentrations is a hugely significant development in our understanding of the ultimate origin of water now present at Earth's surface.\"\nThe observation is the first physical evidence that water can be stored in the deep interiors of planets and solves a 25-year-old controversy about whether the deep Earth is dry, wet, or wet in patches.\nDiscussing his findings, Prof Pearson told BBC News: \"The discovery highlights the unique value of natural diamonds in trapping and preserving fragments of the deep Earth.\n\"It's incredible to think that, as you hold this sample in your hand, the residual pressure at the interface between the diamond and the inclusion is 20,000 atmospheres.\"\nDescribing his diamond sample, he said: \"It looks like it's been to hell and back, which it has.\"\nProf Joseph Smyth of the University of Colorado has spent many years studying ringwoodite and similar minerals synthesised in his laboratory.\nHe said: \"I think it's stunning! It implies that the interior may store several times the amount of water in the oceans. It tells us that hydrogen is an essential ingredient in the Earth and not added late from comets.\n\"This discovery implies that hydrogen may control the interior processes of the Earth just as it controls the surface processes, and that water planets, like Earth, may be common in our galaxy.\"\nA key question posed by the observation is to understand the extent to which plate tectonics on Earth leads to oceans of water being recycled deep within our planet, and to predict the likely amounts of water trapped in other rocky planets.\nRingwoodite is expected to form deep in Mars as well, for example, where it sits against the metallic core.\nGrains of the same mineral synthesised in Prof Smyth's laboratory shine bright blue under the microscope.\nGiven the new findings of ringwoodite's water-bearing capabilities, its abundance at depth, and its beautiful hue, the term \"blue planet\" seems even more appropriate for Earth.","summary":"Minerals preserved in diamond have revealed hints of the bright blue rocks that exist deep within the Earth.","id":"26553115"}

{"document":"Media playback is not supported on this device\nIt's 1997 and ID7 television are filming at Dunkirk rugby club in northern France. Their subject is in his mid-30s, has a full head of hair and is strangely familiar. He's not French, but he's fluent. Only when the cameraman asks him to say his name does the penny drop.\n\"Je m'appelle Vernon Anthony Cotter.\"\nFor four and a half minutes he doesn't miss a beat - and why would he? Cotter had been in the country for years by then. Four seasons playing in the back row with Rumilly in the south-east, two years with Lourdes in the foothills of the Pyrenees, a year with Saint-Junien in west-central France and he would soon kick on for the small southern village of Castelnau-Riviere-Basse, where he played and coached while briefly contemplating a new life as a winemaker.\nCotter is now sitting in Murrayfield talking about the past, the present, the future. The New Zealander has been Scotland coach for 31 Test matches - 16 victories, 15 defeats, nine of which were by seven points or less, five of them by three or less.\nHe's given a first cap to 26 players. Eighteen of the squad he has just named for the Six Nations have appeared on his watch.\nHe has just five more Tests before France reclaims him. Montpellier await. Time for reflection, then. Time to remember where Cotter came from and where he has taken Scotland in his two and a half eventful years.\nCotter is big into culture. Rugby culture. He learned about it first as a player with Counties in New Zealand but a lot of his knowledge came in those early years in France. \"I used to think I was a reasonably physical player, but I was a baby,\" he says.\nI understand New Zealanders so much more after living in Scotland because a lot of the influence comes from here\n\"I learned a lot about character and defending the jersey. You couldn't help but get swept away. The French flair - I used to laugh at that. It wasn't true. Overlaps were created because two forward packs were generally having a good whack at each other.\"\nHe tells a story about a derby match from the mid-90s, his own Lourdes team versus Pau. No love lost between them. In their previous meeting there'd been \"scuffles\" and Lourdes had come off second best.\n\"Our players were doing cartwheels going on to the paddock,\" Cotter recounts. \"The coach said, 'Right boys, tactics for the day. The first five [eighth] kick it straight into the stand and we run up and punch them.' That's what happened. I had somebody who had given me a gentle tickle in the away game and I managed to line him up.\n\"There was an all-out brawl, but no penalty. We had a scrum in midfield and our locks came through and caressed the opposition front row a little bit with their hands. A couple of them needed treatment and we scored a try from there. It was an insight.\n\"It wasn't just a game. I enjoyed the fact that you were playing for your town and your colours. They could be absolute psychopaths on the paddock and gentlemen afterwards.\"\nYears later, while coaching at Clermont, Cotter was given a nickname - les yeux de glace ('eyes of ice'). Years after that, in Scotland, he was christened Stern Vern. To understand what makes him tick, the period of his life in a country where he's already done 17 years, and where he will soon return for another three, is important.\nEight seasons at Clermont turned Cotter into one of the hottest coaching tickets in world rugby. The season before he took over, the club finished a poor eighth in the French championship. In his first year - and for the three years that followed - they made the final.\nIn 2010 they won the first league title in their history. Cotter - with his great friend Joe Schmidt as assistant coach - had become immortal in the French game.\nClermont were never out of the top four on Cotter's watch. Then, the move to Scotland. Not a lot of people in France could understand why he did it. Going to New Zealand, they would have understood. England, they could get. Ireland, perhaps. But Scotland?\n\"It's something that I didn't have to do, it's something that we wanted to do as a family,\" he explains.\n\"One of the key motivating factors was that people [in France] would take the mickey out of Scotland and its rugby. It sort of upset me. I was defending the underdog.\n\"Before the Six Nations, everybody would take a sweepstake and Scotland was always last pick.\n\"Look, I remember the 1990s. I remember Scotland coming to New Zealand [in the summer of 1990] and they should have beaten the All Blacks. We weren't inventing the game, Scotland were doing it. When we first came together as a squad we looked at some footage of those days. They were brave, confident warriors.\n\"Trying to bring that back to Scotland was one of the key things. They [Jim Telfer and Ian McGeechan, the coaches of the era] were ahead of their time. Any comparison to those two great men is very nice. I would take inspiration from what they did. The game has moved on but some of the essential things they were coaching are still relevant, especially to the Scottish psyche.\n\"Scotland has a proud history. It's a humble country and it's a place you can become attached to very quickly.\"\nIn Cotter's first Six Nations, in 2015, Scotland got whitewashed, Wooden-spooned and, at times, embarrassed. Last season brought progression. The brilliance and pain of the near-miss against Australia in the World Cup, the home win against France in the Six Nations, the fact - incredible as it seems - that 2016 was the first time in the 17-year history of the competition that Scotland managed to score more points than they conceded, and hit double figures for tries scored.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nScotland have become an exciting team. More than at any point since last winning the championship under Telfer in 1999, they're posing a threat to the big nations.\n\"The principal foundations are mindset and skill-set,\" says Cotter. \"It was about creating clarity.\n\"The other thing is leadership, creating a leadership group so that they determine behaviour and standards because it's always much easier when you have a group that can think on its feet, that's autonomous. I think that's where we're getting.\n\"You've got a team that's experienced some good things and some bad things. We've become aware of what we can do. Winning is the most important thing. So how do we win? We go through a painful process of learning how to win.\n\"There's been improvement. Would we have liked quicker improvement? Yeah, we probably would. Would we have liked to nail some of those close games? Yes. But we've used them as benchmarks.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nOn the opening day of the Six Nations, Ireland come to Edinburgh. \"We played them at the end of the competition in the last two years and their strength in depth showed through,\" Cotter recalls.\n\"We have more depth now to stay a bit more robust until the end. I'd like to think this game will be closer than those two.\n\"It's a really big challenge for our guys. Joe [Schmidt, Ireland coach] is a really good friend and we'll probably have a beer afterwards. Unfortunately, he's always the one with the smile on his face - and I'd like it to stop. I'd like to get one back on him.\"\nBeyond that, it's a trip to France, then a visit from Wales, then a journey down to England. Scotland have moved forward, but that's no guarantee of victories in the coming weeks.\n\"We know that these teams are very good,\" he insists. \"When they see us on the fixture list they know they're going in as favourites, very confident that they'll beat us. It's our job to try to surprise them somehow, to have something that will take them away from the comfort zone and create errors in their game that we can exploit.\"\nFive more games and then he's away. It's not the way he planned it. It's just the way it is, he says.\nWhen the news broke that this was going to be Cotter's final Six Nations, an audible gasp could have been heard around Scottish rugby.

{"document":"Labour said 160,000 people would lose out as a result of changes to Personal Independence Payments (PIPs).\nThe disability minister said new rules to clarify eligibility criteria for payments would ensure those most in need received maximum support.\nThe action follows two court judgements on how benefits claims are scored.\nLabour said the government was not listening to criticism of how payments are assessed.\nThe Liberal Democrats said the government was using court losses \"as an excuse to severely restrict disability benefits\".\nDisability rights campaigners said the changes were one of a number of cuts and changes faced by disabled people and those in ill health.\nTwo tribunal rulings came in late 2016. One found someone who needed support at home to take medication or monitor a health condition like diabetes would score the same on the benefits criteria as people who needed help with a therapy such as kidney dialysis.\nA second ruling said people who struggled to travel independently because of conditions such as anxiety scored the same as someone who was, for example, blind.\nThe government said the combined effects of the rulings would have added \u00a33.7bn to the benefits bill by 2023.\nThe benefit payments are aimed at helping people cope with the extra costs of living with ill health or disability and are made according to the points a person scores in an assessment of their needs.\nThe replacement of Disability Living Allowance (DLA), which was partly self-assessed, with PIPs, where eligibility is tested by a company, has been controversial.\nEligibility for PIPs is reviewed regularly and the qualifying criteria are also stricter.\nIn a written statement to the House of Commons on Thursday, Minister for Disabled People, Health and Work Penny Mordaunt said the government monitored how effective the payment was in supporting those facing the greatest barriers to leading independent lives.\nShe said that PIPs were designed to give \"non-physical conditions... the same recognition as physical ones\".\nBut she added: \"Now, over two thirds of PIP claimants with mental health conditions get the higher Daily Living award, worth \u00a382.30 per week, compared to 22% under DLA.\"\nShe said amendments to the criteria would \"provide greater clarity\", saying: \"This will not result in any claimants seeing a reduction in the amount of PIP previously awarded by DWP (the Department of Work and Pensions).\"\nBut Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary, Debbie Abrahams, said: \"Instead of listening to the court's criticisms of Personal Independence Payment assessments and correcting these injustices, the government has instead decided to undermine the legal basis of the rulings.\"\nIt was an \"unprecedented attempt\" to subvert a tribunal judgement, she said.\nShe said Labour would fight changes to \"strip\" entitlements from more than 160,000 disabled people - describing them as a \"step too far, even for this Tory government\".\nA Lib Dem work and pensions spokeswoman said it was \"utterly outrageous\" the government was using the ruling to \"make matters worse\" for disabled people.\n\"What makes things even worse is that they have sneaked this announcement out under the cover of [Thursday's] by-elections,\" she said.\nCampaigners said the government should instead embrace the tribunal's findings.\nPhilip Connolly from Disability Rights UK said the changes showed \"escalating levels of unfairness\" in the government's approach to a benefit it had created.\nPeople with \"very serious conditions\" including dementia, learning difficulties and diabetes would be hit, he said.\nThis change was one of several benefit cuts disabled people faced, he said.\nCampaigners are due to stage a protest in Westminster on Wednesday about a \u00a329-a-week cut to employment support payments.\nA DWP spokeswoman said the government was \"committed to ensuring our welfare system is a strong safety net for those who need it.\n\"That's why we spend around \u00a350bn a year to support people with disabilities and health conditions.\"","summary":"Opposition parties have criticised moves to cut \u00a33.7bn from the benefits bill by reducing the number of people eligible for disability benefit.","id":"39088847"}

{"document":"Head of the Army General Sir Nick Carter said the move was about trying to operate \"smarter\".\nThe 77th Brigade, made up of reservists and regular troops and based in Hermitage, Berkshire, will be formally created in April.\nIt has been inspired by the Chindits who fought in Burma in World War Two.\nAn Army spokesman said the unit would \"play a key part in enabling the UK to fight in the information age\" and that it \"consists of more than just traditional capabilities\".\nHe said: \"77 Brigade is being created to draw together a host of existing and developing capabilities essential to meet the challenges of modern conflict and warfare.\n\"It recognises that the actions of others in a modern battlefield can be affected in ways that are not necessarily violent and it draws heavily on important lessons from our commitments to operations in Afghanistan amongst others.\"\nRecruitment for the brigade, 42% of whose personnel will be reservists, will begin this spring.\nIts members will come from the Royal Navy and RAF as well as from the Army.\nOne former commander of British forces in Afghanistan has warned the new operation should not mean fewer troops on the frontline.\nColonel Richard Kemp said: \"My view is that this should not be done at the expense of combat troops. Where are these 2,000 people going to come from?\"\n\"They are likely to come from savings made in combat troops. I think that's a mistake.\n\"I think the British forces have already been cut far too much in a very uncertain and increasingly dangerous world.\nHe acknowledged the need for this type of innovation, but said \"it should be added to the forces, not created out of savings found elsewhere.\"\nThe creation of the new unit is part of a major restructuring of the military under the Army 2020 plan, which will see the military scaled down to around 82,000 regular troops in the next five years.\nThe unit will also seek \"new ways of allowing civilians with bespoke skills to serve alongside their military counterparts\".\nThe Army spokesman said it would share the \"spirit of innovation\" of the Chindits in the Burma Campaign of 1942 to 1945.\nChindits was the name given to the Long Range Penetration (LRP) groups that operated in the Burmese jungle behind enemy lines, targeting Japanese communications.\nThe new unit will also use the old Chindit insignia of a Chinthe, a mythical Burmese creature which is half-lion and half-dragon.\nTony Redding from Kent, whose father was in the Chindits, told the BBC he was disappointed by the move. He said: \"Sadly the Ministry of Defence didn't inform the surviving Chindit veterans of the decision to use the badge in this way.\n\"I've tried very hard to look for similarities and the only common denominator I can find is that the Chindits 70 years ago were a highly unconventional force. Perhaps this new force are to use some unconventional means of warfare.\"\nBy BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale\nThe Army says it's learnt valuable lessons from Afghanistan - not least that it can't win wars using pure military force alone.\nThe brigade will be made up of warriors who don't just carry weapons, but who are also skilled in using social media such as Twitter and Facebook, and the dark arts of \"psyops\" - psychological operations.\nThey will try to influence local populations and change behaviour through what the Army calls traditional and unconventional means.\nCivilians with the right skills will work alongside regular troops and reservists and could be sent anywhere in the world to help win hearts and minds.\nIt can be seen as proof that the Army is adapting to modern asymmetric warfare, and that it remains relevant at a time when there are fears within the British military of more cuts after the election.\nPaul Rogers, a professor of international security at the University of Bradford, said the announcement represented a \"big expansion\" of the Army's psychological operations and was an \"attempt to rebrand and update\" this area of its work.\n\"We had so much difficulty in Iraq and Afghanistan, it's about trying to learn the lessons of how these groups are using social media,\" Prof Rogers explained.\nHe added: \"In some senses it's defensive - trying to present the case from this side against opponents who hold many of the cards.\n\"We've seen with Islamic State, its incredible capability on the net, Facebook, Instagram and all the rest.\"\nA former Army officer involved in psychological operations in the Balkans, Afghanistan and Iraq, Simon Bergman, predicted it would help build \"the Army for the future\".\n\"For example, 77 brigade have a large component of civil affairs soldiers who'll be operating in populations, working with them, achieving military effects - and a broader effect, because as we know from Afghanistan, the military doesn't work in isolation.

{"document":"Media playback is not supported on this device\nBut the West Midlands team have come a long way since their formation in 1991 and can make history on Saturday by reaching the first round of the FA Cup for the first time.\nIt will not be easy against the relative giants of FC United of Manchester but, whatever happens at the Aspray Arena, it will be another chapter in a remarkable story.\nSporting Khalsa are fifth in the Midland League Premier Division, the ninth tier of the English football pyramid. On Tuesday, they won at Brocton. The attendance was 87.\nOn Saturday, in excess of 2,000 supporters are expected for the visit of National League North side FC United, who play three tiers above Khalsa, in the FA Cup fourth qualifying round.\nThe winners will earn \u00a312,500 and enter Monday's first-round draw alongside 2008 winners Portsmouth and Wigan, who lifted the trophy by beating Manchester City at Wembley in 2013.\n\"Preparations started on Sunday because we had to clear an access route for vans to bring in the marquees we are having to use because our bar is not big enough,\" said Inder Grewa, one of Sporting Khalsa's 12 owners, who also acts as treasurer.\n\"We have never before had to think about marquees because we normally only have 50 people here.\n\"There was a load of old metal and chairs that needed shifting. Grass verges had to be dug and stone had to be put down to level it off.\n\"At our level we can't afford to pay people to clear the site. We rely on volunteers.\n\"We sent one email out and had around 20 people turn up, including the manager and some of the players.\"\nPrior to this FA Cup run, Sporting Khalsa had never had an attendance in three figures, but there were 750 at the Aspray Arena for the visit of Spalding in the third qualifying round.\nOn Saturday, a combination of local interest and FC United's healthy away following - many of whom are intent on making a trip to nearby Dudley to see the statue of legendary Manchester United and England player Duncan Edwards - could see three times that many turn up.\nNormal home match plans have had to be altered at a club where stadium and bar manager Bal Gacha is the only full-time member of staff.\n\"We usually print the programmes ourselves on a colour printer,\" Grewa told BBC Sport.\n\"But we have not been able to do that this weekend because instead of 20 we have had to get a thousand done.\n\"We have gone up from two stewards to 30.\n\"We have brought the marquees in because we simply could not accommodate the numbers we are expecting in the bar. Food will be available, though.\"\nAh yes, the now famous curry house, located within the 4-4-2 bar adjacent to the ground, open on match and non-matchdays.\n\"We just thought it would be an add-on,\" said Grewa.\n\"We feed the players but football comes first. Everything here is working towards improving the football side.\"\nIt is safe to assume neither Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger nor Aston Villa boss Tim Sherwood were required for landscaping duties before last season's FA Cup final.\nBut that was one of the jobs keeping Sporting Khalsa manager Ian Rowe busy this week after answering the call to help create the access route.\nBuilding is nothing new for this Black Country club, sandwiched between Wolverhampton and Walsall, whose story of traversing one side of Noose Lane, where it all began in 1991, to the other, where the Asprey Arena is located, is a compelling one, even if it comes with a sad reminder that some racial stereotypes still run deep.\nSporting Khalsa emerged from a group of a dozen Sikh lads who would meet on Willenhall Memorial Park for a kickabout at weekends.\nPlaying standards varied. Passion for the game was in them all.\nSporting Khalsa entered the local Walsall and District Sunday League, then moved into Saturday football, pushing the boundaries of what could be achieved.\nIn 2004 they joined the West Midlands Regional League. Three promotions have taken them to the upper echelons of the Midland League.\nDecisions now, as they always have, are achieved through discussion and consensus, sometimes in the car as they travel to away games.\nSporting Khalsa's architects were Asian. Their official website calls them a semi-professional Asian club.\nBut it has always been open to all, regardless of religion, skin colour and gender.\nThey bought a pitch at Bloxwich Town but when Aspray Arena became available after Willenhall Town went into administration in 2009, the opportunity to relocate to a stadium barely 400 yards from the Sunday league pitches where the Sporting Khalsa concept first emerged was too tempting to reject.\n\"There is a group of 12 who you could say are the core of the club,\" said Grewa.\n\"We were always aware some of us could not play at a good standard. But we just love the game - and we wanted to see how far we could push ourselves.\n\"You still get the odd comment. We were at an away match recently and someone said, 'I thought you lot only played cricket', so that stereotype is still there.\n\"It makes me angry that something like that still happens because it is absolutely not true.\n\"We just love football. It doesn't matter to us if you are black, green or yellow. We welcome anybody.\n\"We have kids teams from under-6s upwards and four ladies teams. We are a community club - and the community is everybody.\"\nThe club have ambitions of climbing higher up the football pyramid, but there is also a conflict about how progress could permanently alter the identity of the club.\n\"We want to get to the National League,\" said Grewa.\n\"Once you go into the Football League, it becomes a business. I don't know whether we want that.\n\"The founders of the club have never fallen out. That only happens if there is money involved. As it is, everyone is treated equally.\n\"Up to the National League, we could still do our jobs and handle it.\"\nAt 15:00 BST on Saturday, the dreaming must stop.\nBy any logic, Sporting Khalsa do not stand a chance of bridging the gap to FC United, akin to a League Two side taking on a Premier League team.\nThey do have an international, central defender Tes Robinson, who plays for St Kitts and Nevis. They also have a forward, Craig Bannister, who has scored nine times in this season's FA Cup.\nSaturday's match is Sporting Khalsa's seventh FA Cup tie of the season, more than Arsenal played in lifting the trophy in 2014-15.\nThe players share lifts to away games. Many still play Sunday football in addition to Saturdays. And it was not known for certain until less than 24 hours before they left for their replay against Spalding last week that their goalkeeper and winger would be able to play because of work commitments.\n\"I am a Manchester United fan,\" said manager Ian Rowe, who was appointed at the start of the 2014-15 season.\n\"I have followed the FC United story from the start. Next to having my kids, this will be one of the proudest moments of my life.\n\"But let's not kid ourselves. The chance of us reaching the level we will need to win this game is probably one in a hundred.\n\"AFC Fylde are in the same league as FC United. They beat a team in our league 9-0.

The party also has 38 MSPs in Edinburgh's Holyrood parliament and they will seek re-election in 2016.\nIn her resignation letter to Scottish Labour chairman Jamie Glackin Ms Lamont said the referendum had \"opened a new chapter in the debate about the future of the Scottish Labour Party\".\nShe added: \"In order that we can have the real discussion about how we take Scottish Labour forward, I believe it would be best if I took  myself out of the equation and stepped down as leader.\"\nShe described Labour's challenge in Scotland as \"serious\", but added \"I strongly believe that the Labour Party is not only our best chance of achieving a better, fairer Scotland, it's our only chance\".\nThere are two versions of this story.  In one version, Scottish Labour's departing leader, Johann Lamont, accuses her Westminster colleagues - and, by implication, Ed Miliband - of undermining her and failing to grasp how much Scotland has changed.  She says some of her MP colleagues are \"dinosaurs\".\nThe alternative version is that Johann Lamont wasn't up to the job - that she failed to counter the SNP, that she failed to modernise the party sufficiently to cope with a new Scotland where people are no longer prepared to back Labour as a duty, that she failed to attract new talent who might freshen up the party's portrait for the electorate in 2016, when Holyrood goes to the polls.\nReacting to news of the resignation, SNP deputy leader Nicola Sturgeon said that Ms Lamont \"carries my personal best wishes\".\nBut she added: \"There is no question that her shock resignation reveals Labour to be in complete meltdown in Scotland.\"\nMs Sturgeon said: \"The scale of the infighting between Scottish Labour and Labour at Westminster is exposed for all to see.\"\nThe timetable for choosing a new leader will be set out soon.\nIn the meantime, deputy leader Anas Sarwar is in charge and an MSP will be chosen to stand in for Ms Lamont at Holyrood.\nWhoever replaces her will become Scottish Labour's seventh leader since the Scottish Parliament was established 15 years ago.\nMs Lamont, a former English teacher who joined the Labour Party as a teenager, has represented the Glasgow Pollok constituency at Holyrood since 1999.\nShe took over as the party's Scottish leader in the aftermath of the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, when Labour suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of the SNP.\nIn the weeks after the independence referendum, she said she wanted to lead Labour to victory in the next Holyrood election in 2016 and become first minister.\nLabour leader Ed Miliband said she deserved \"significant credit\" for the successful \"No\" vote in the Scottish referendum campaign.\nHe added: \"She campaigned the length and breadth of Scotland making the case for social justice within the United Kingdom.\n\"She has led the Scottish Labour Party with determination. I know she will continue to serve her constituents.\n\"Having elected a new leader, I believe the party will show the same will and determination it did in the referendum campaign to help us to victory in the general election of 2015 and the Scottish elections of 2016.\"\nFormer prime minister Gordon Brown has constantly been linked to the job, as has fellow MP Jim Murphy, who also played a prominent role in the referendum campaign.\nMr Brown said he was sorry to hear that Ms Lamont had resigned.\nHe added; \"She brought determination, compassion and a down-to-earth approach to the leadership and deserves great credit for taking on the challenge after 2011.\n\"I wish her well in the future.\"\nSenior Labour sources have indicated that both the former Prime minister, Gordon Brown and the former Scottish Secretary , Jim Murphy, will be approached to see if they are willing to lead the Labour Party in Scotland.\nIf the two men refuse another scenario being canvassed is for a joint ticket between the MP Anas Sarwar and the MSP Kezia Dugdale.\nMr Sarwar would be the leader and would seek to improve relations between Westminster and Holyrood. Ms Dugdale  would lead the group at Holyrood. One Labour source described this as the \"ideal option\".\nOthers believe Mr Murphy should be encouraged to stand. One figure said that if \"Jim doesn't stand it will be a disaster\", but added he believed the shadow cabinet member could be persuaded.","summary":"Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont has resigned saying senior party members had \"questioned\" her role amid the \"serious challenges\" faced by the party after September's referendum.","id":"29772670"}

Last week, he said women and children were being killed \"in large numbers\" by Russian raids.\nMr Medvedev said Russia was \"not trying to achieve some secret goals in Syria\", adding that \"we are trying to protect our national interests\".\nTheir comments were made at a security conference in Munich, days after world powers agreed a deal to push for a cessation of hostilities in Syria within a week.\nAgreement to try to bring about a cessation of hostilities and allow more access for humanitarian aid was reached by world powers late on Thursday in Germany, but neither the Syrian government nor the rebels were involved.\nUnder the plan, efforts will be made to try to make urgent aid deliveries to besieged and hard-to-reach areas in Syria. Steps will also be taken to work towards an eventual ceasefire and implementation of a UN-backed plan for political transition in Syria.\nThe halt will not apply to the battle against jihadist groups Islamic State (IS) and al-Nusra Front.\nThe tentative deal reached here in Munich to pause the fighting in Syria was always going to be a tough sell to the warring parties on the ground. Now its chances of success look even slimmer - \"Forty-nine per cent,\" said Russia's foreign minister. \"Closer to zero,\" said his British counterpart.\nFor much of the day the Russian and Western ministers have been trading accusations and counter-accusations as to who is to blame for the ongoing misery that is the Syrian civil war.\nFrance, Britain and the US all accused Russia of targeting mainstream rebels and civilians with air strikes while leaving so-called Islamic State largely unscathed. Russia flatly denied this, saying most of those civilians were being besieged by rebels rather than by Assad's forces. Again, Western delegates disagreed.\nSo there are clearly two, diametrically opposed, versions of what is going on in Syria. That leaves little prospect of the concerted effort for peace by all parties that is so desperately needed.\nRebel groups in Syria have told the BBC they would not stop fighting because they do not believe that Russia will end its bombing campaign in support of the government.\nThey also reiterated their demand that President Assad be removed from power. On Friday, the president said he wanted to retake \"the whole country\" from rebels.\nBut US state department spokesman Mark Toner said Mr Assad was \"deluded\" if he thought there was a military solution to the conflict.\nSyrian government forces, backed by Russian air strikes, have almost encircled rebels in parts of the northern city of Aleppo.\nMore than 250,000 people have been killed and some 11 million displaced in almost five years of fighting in Syria.\nIn another sign of the complexity of the conflict, reports said that on Saturday Turkish forces had shelled Kurdish militia targets in Aleppo provinces.\nThe Kurdish fighters had seized territory from Islamists in recent days. Turkey views the Kurdish militia as allied to the PKK group, which has a waged a campaign against Turkish security forces for decades.\nOn Saturday, Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Saudi Arabia would send war planes to the Turkish air base of Incirlik, from where they would attack militants in Syria from the so-called Islamic State.\nSaudi Arabia is already part of the international coalition against IS.\nMr Cavusoglu also said it was possible that troops from his country and Saudi Arabia might participate in a ground operation against IS forces. The US has so far ruled out a ground invasion.\nMoscow has warned against any new foreign ground intervention in the country, saying such a development could even lead to a world war.\nWhy is there a war in Syria?\nAnti-government protests developed into a civil war that, five years on, has ground to a stalemate, with the Assad government, Islamic State, an array of Syrian rebels and Kurdish fighters all holding territory.\nWho is fighting whom?\nGovernment forces concentrated in Damascus and the centre and west of Syria are fighting the jihadists of Islamic State and al-Nusra Front, as well as less numerous so-called \"moderate\" rebel groups, who are strongest in the north and east. These groups are also battling each other.\nHow has the world reacted?\nIran, Russia and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement are propping up the Alawite-led Assad government, while Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar back the Sunni-dominated opposition, along with the US, UK and France. Hezbollah and Iran are believed to have troops and officers on the ground, while a Western-led coalition and Russia are carrying out air strikes.","summary":"Pressure is increasing on Russia over civilian deaths in Syria, with France and the US urging greater caution.","id":"35568692"}
{"document":"Lifelong fan Hearn sold the club to the Italian for \u00a34m in July 2014.\nThis week the club was served with a winding-up petition from Revenue & Customs for non-payment of tax, with a High Court hearing set for 20 March.\n\"Looking where we are now, I would never have sold if I had thought this was going to happen,\" Hearn said. \"Hindsight is a wonderful advisor.\"\nHe told BBC Radio 5 live: \"At the time I thought it was perfect for everybody - fans, myself, the club.\"\nHearn, who was Orient chairman for 19 years, said when the takeover was completed, he and fans were \"pretty certain\" that Becchetti, who made a fortune in waste management and recycling, would prove to be a good owner.\n\"He had a very engaging personality,\" the 68-year-old said. \"He seemed passionate about what he wanted to do, and he has done what he told me he was going to do - he has injected many, many millions of pounds into Leyton Orient.\n\"It is just that putting the money in, and spending it wisely are not always the same things.\"\nA meeting of the Leyton Orient Fans' Trust (Loft) on Thursday night agreed on what the group calls \"a last-resort measure\" to try to save the relegation-threatened club.\nShould Becchetti not pay the tax bill before the court date, then at the winding-up hearing the fans would seek the appointment of an administrator, despite the fact it would mean the club being deducted 12 points under English Football League rules.\nAn administrator would then look to sell the club as a going concern to a potential new owner.\n\"That application would be made as late as possible to give the club's current owner time to settle the bill,\" said Loft spokesman Tom Davies.\nHowever, he added that should an adjournment of the court hearing provide a more stable course and future for the club, then they would favour an adjournment.\nIn addition, Loft has launched a crowd funding page to try to raise \u00a3250,000 - reportedly the tax sum owed by the club.\nLoft also want to meet Hearn, still the chairman of World Snooker, to discuss its plans for saving the club.\n\"I have been a bit critical of fans' trusts in the past up and down the country. Some of them have worked, but some of them have been abysmal failures,\" he said.\n\"But I think they should be encouraged and applauded for looking at the situation. It comes down to what plan they have in their mind, what is the sustainability of the club within that plan and what management, because it is all about management.\"\nHearn still owns Orient's Matchroom Stadium. But for that, he believes it could have been sold for redevelopment.\n\"Fortunately Leyton Orient have got a 20-year lease on the ground, with another 20-year option. I did it on purpose because I could never be 100% sure where I was selling,\" he added.\n\"I kept the ground to make sure it wasn't used for the wrong reasons - that it wasn't the wrong reasons for buying a football club. Thank goodness I kept it because I would imagine now, with the situation it is, developers would be knocking on the door tomorrow.\"\nWhen asked by BBC Sport, Leyton Orient declined to respond to Hearn's remarks or comment on Loft's proposals.","summary":"Former Leyton Orient owner Barry Hearn says he now regrets selling the club to businessman Francesco Becchetti.","id":"39151664"}
{"document":"In the press release for the new record The Systems Are Failing, the musician writes: \"We're destroying the world, and we're still miserable. Fat, sick, stupid and anxious are no ways to live.\n\"These systems are failing. Let them fail. Change or die.\"\nWhat makes this different from a Moby album?\nI think a lot of people think of me as making sort of down-tempo quiet, electronic living room music and this record is much more of a fast, aggressive post-punk record and, based on the reactions I've had so far, people have been a little nonplussed at that.\nWhat reactions specifically? Do people think you're crazy or are they applauding a brave new direction?\nBoth in equal measure, part of what led me to want to make a record like this, is the awareness that people don't really buy records any more and people especially don't buy records from 51-year-old musicians who are making their 15th record, so with those two things in mind there's also a sense of emancipation that comes with that.\nYou can either bemoan the fact that, in 2016 the audience for albums is quite small, but I see it as being really liberating because there's no external pressure at all. I'm not trying to sell records, I'm not trying to get on the radio, I'm honestly just trying to make a record that excites me and that I think is interesting.\nYou've been very commercially successful and some might say that puts you in the privileged position of not having to worry about it.\nYes and it would be hard for me to argue that. I would feel absurdly presumptuous criticising anyone else's choices, there are a lot of musicians who have children or alimony payments or sick relatives, so they need to make commercial compromises in order to pay the rent. I'm lucky because I live a relatively simple life and I can make whatever music I want to make without any worry about any commercial ramifications.\nIn your mission statement for this project you state: 'When some of my middle-aged compatriots try to accommodate the pop market place, the results are so anodyne and depressing'. Did you have someone specific in mind?\nI did have people in mind but, in the interest of avoiding public feuds, I can't even begin to name names because in the course of my life, whenever I've criticised a fellow musician, it has ended up being something that I have truly regretted. But the truth is that a majority of musicians as they age don't do so in a graceful way. What I mean by that is, I understand that as you age, you want to hold on to your glory days and for most musicians that was decades ago, so you find yourself dressing the same way and touring and taking out your contact lenses so the audience will be blurry and look bigger than it is.  If I don't have to go down that route, I'd just as soon not.\nBut your album Play was the first album to have every track licensed to advertisers - if a corporation came to you now and asked to use Don't Leave Me from the new album - what would you do?\nI have a feeling that on my death bed the last question someone asks me before I die will be about licensing music to advertisements. At this point, most of what I do and I hesitate to say this because it does sound a little self-aggrandising but it's sincere, is that most of the work I do now is non-profit.\nI own a restaurant in LA and 100% of the profits goes to animal welfare charities and my only show this year is a fundraiser for an animal rights group. I don't mean that in a self-congratulatory way, I just mean my criteria has changed. How do my choices benefit the causes that I care about? So, if an advertiser came to me with a dump truck full of money to license a song, I would probably say \"yes\" and simply direct the dump truck to one of the organisations I work with.\nI've always tried to employ that ethos when it comes to advertising,  like \"rob from the rich and give to the poor\" or, more accurately, \"take from corporations and give to those who work against those corporations\". But even when I was being crucified for that, I really didn't want to talk about it because it seemed defensive. It made me uncomfortable trying to justify myself even if there was justification there.\nWith that and the Pacific Void manifesto, it sounds like you're having a conscientious mid-life crisis but, instead of buying a sports car, you're trying to right the world's wrongs.\nI've always been potentially an annoying, opinionated loudmouth. I was raised by very active hippies with an idea that whatever you do, in so far as you can, you should try and make the world a better place. Again, I can't be so presumptuous to say I am making it a better place but at least I want to try. There's so much, especially in the public arena, of this shameless, endless self-promotion that it just makes me nauseous.\nI don't want to be like them, there are too many horrifying pressing issues. Just putting out a new fashion line or lending your name to a perfume company would be fine if the world wasn't an inch away from catastrophe.\nIs this your main creative drive now or will you go back to recording under Moby?\nI made a record about two years ago that was very choral and so I used the name The Void Pacific Choir, which is a DH Lawrence quote because I liked it, but I scrapped the album and then started work on this one but I kept the name. But the truth is that it's me on my own so if I go back and record something under my name, it all seems kind of arbitrary to me.\nDo you intend on touring the new album?\nDear God no. It's another thing that's emancipating . Most musicians put out a record with the intent of touring and my intention is to never tour again as long as I live because I hate touring. I love playing music but going to the same airports and the same hotels and the law of diminishing returns, as you age you play smaller venues and you try and play new songs but the audience just want to hear the hits which I understand because when I go to see middle-aged musicians, I want to see the hits.\nBut if I never ever go on tour again, I would be very happy.\nHave you said everything you need to with this album?\nI've already made the follow-up record, I'm just trying to figure out when my record label will let me release it. Part two is all ready to go but clearly record companies don't love middle-aged musicians who refuse to tour, so I can't be too haughty and high-handed with them. I have to rely on their good graces.\nThe debut album by Moby & The Void Pacific Choir is released 14 October 2016.\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram at bbcnewsents, or if you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.","summary":"Electronic producer Moby has returned with a new project and pseudo-political manifesto Moby and the Pacific Void Choir.","id":"37493670"}

Some 11.5 million others - more than half of the country's population - have fled their homes.\nRebels have made numerous attempts to seize key installations held by the government, but with little effect.\nOn Thursday, 13 Islamist fighting groups and al-Nusra Front, al-Qaeda's affiliate in Syria, came together to launch a co-ordinated assault on several fronts.\nA statement said the aim of the new coalition, called Ansar al-Sharia (Partisans of Islamic Law), was \"the liberation of Aleppo and its countryside\", after which they would work with other groups to govern the city according to Islamic law.\nWestern-backed groups also said they were taking part in the offensive, organised through a joint operations room called Fatah Halab (Conquest of Aleppo), the New York Times reported.\nThe rebels launched simultaneous attacks on western districts of the city controlled by government forces, firing hundreds of rockets and shells, the Syrian Observatory reported.\nThe offensive unleashed on government-held western Aleppo by Ansar al-Sharia seems to be the most serious since the battle for Aleppo began.\nAn early test of its prospects will be one of the first apparent objectives - the loathed and feared Air Force Intelligence headquarters in Zahra, on the western edge of the city. Rebels have tried many times to capture it, and failed.\nThe offensive has been building up for some time, following the capture of Idlib by a newly-coalesced rebel alliance, Jaish al-Fatah (Victory Army), in March.\nWhat's making the difference is that rebel groups, and their outside backers like Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which were competing in the past, now seem to be pulling together - bad news for the regime.\nThe success of the new campaign may depend on whether Damascus is seriously determined to hang on to Aleppo. If it is, rebel progress will be slow and hard.\nThe UK-based group said the fighting continued into the early hours of Friday and was focused on the frontline in Zahra, a heavily-defended area that houses several major security compounds.\nAt least nine people were killed and dozens wounded by the rebel barrage, it added.\nThe military responded with a heavy aerial and artillery bombardment of rebel positions in the city, and the fighting continued for several hours.\nOn Friday morning, military sources told Sana and Reuters news agency that the assault had been repelled and that heavy casualties had been inflicted on the rebels.\nThe Syrian Observatory said the rebels had managed to seize some buildings in the north-western outskirts of Aleppo, but that the gains were not of strategic importance.\nThe BBC's Jim Muir in Beirut says that if the rebels do manage to capture all Aleppo, it would be a huge blow to the government.\nThere have been persistent reports in recent weeks that it is preparing to give up both the northern city, and Deraa in the south, the better to defend the core areas of western Syria with the limited manpower at its disposal, he adds.\nBut state media reported that the prime minister has just been in Aleppo, visiting front-line units and dispensing large amounts of cash to the city authorities for reconstruction and administrative expenses.","summary":"The Syrian military has carried out a series of air strikes after rebel forces launched a major assault to take control of the northern city of Aleppo.","id":"33373410"}

We are working on that but it is looking good.\"\nThe supporters will have a smile for one afternoon, one night, and it is not the easiest time for the country at the moment\nAlonso qualified only fifth in Spain but fought through to win after moving up to third on the first lap and then using an aggressive four-stop strategy that allowed him to exploit the Ferrari's race pace.\nIt was his second victory of the year, to follow on from a win in China last month, and he finished second to Raikkonen in Australia, the only other race in which he has not had problems.\nIn Malaysia, he damaged his front wing in a collision with Vettel on lap one and then retired when it broke after he did not come in to change it.\nIn Bahrain, he finished eighth after problems with his DRS overtaking aid.\nAlonso said: \"We have only had five races in the championship. In these five races, we have nearly two retirements and without this we were maybe leading now a little comfortably.\n\"So what we need to do is have consistent podium results for the next four or five races and that will bring us a lot of points to put in the pocket.\"\nAlonso had a scare when one of his tyres got a puncture before his final pit stop, but the team were able to bring him in two laps earlier than planned to avoid a problem.\n\"We decided to play safe after Malaysia, where we were a little bit brave trying to do one extra lap with the front wing broken and we crashed in that lap.\n\"Here it could have affected the strategy because it was stopping too early, but it was OK and didn't affect the result.\"\nThe victory was Alonso's third in his home country, following his 2006 Spanish Grand Prix win for Renault and last year's victory in the European Grand Prix in Valencia.\nHe was cheered by the packed grandstands and afterwards paid tribute to the fans, making a reference to the troubled economic situation in Spain as a result of the Eurozone crisis.\n\"It is fantastic,\" he said. \"Winning at home is always like you did it for the first time.

{"document":"Our part of the country has long been a two-party affair to a greater extent than anywhere else in the country, so a straightforward device pointing this way and then that was almost invariably quite good enough to do the job.\nBut what, I ask myself, would we need to visualise the infinite variety of 2015?\nThe best idea I have managed to come up with so far goes like this.\nImagine you suspend a needle from a thread above a table on which you position magnets of varying strengths and political colours in a circle.\nThey symbolise the interactions between the parties in each constituency.\nLower the needle towards the centre of the table and see which way it points. [Don't worry, BBC graphics designers, I'm not seriously thinking of doing this. Not yet at least!]\nBut the important point here is that the composition of the different magnets and their respective strengths would be very different from one constituency to another.\nIn this era of multi-party politics, every single seat is more or less a law unto itself.\nTake for example two of our key local marginals, Dudley North and Solihull.\nIn the Black Country seat, Labour are defending a majority of just 649.\nIn 2010 their closest challengers were the Conservatives. This time, though, with nine seats on the local council its is UKIP who are breathing down Labour's neck.\nSolihull is another key Conservative target. The Liberal Democrats had a majority over them of just 175 last time round. But since then, the Green Party has established itself as a real force in the town, thanks to a potent combination of green belt and housing issues.\nExtreme examples though they may be, these two constituencies reinforce the point that whether or not UKIP or the Greens succeed in winning seats themselves, or even come close to doing so, they will undoubtedly have significant and differing impacts on the established parties from one seat to another.\nLike a collection of by-elections perhaps?\nThat may be overstating it. But I am becoming increasingly convinced that this election offers us regional and local broadcasters a unique opportunity to explore the local dynamics of individual seats and to explain the possibility that in the shake-out of seats between the biggest parties it is not unreasonable to envisage gains and losses in both directions.\nAnd what does this tell us about those headline national poll ratings pointing to a hung Parliament, in which the two biggest parties in lock step with each other followed by UKIP, the Liberal Democrats and then the Greens?\nOr, about those \"percentage swing to win or lose\" statistics which have been calculated in a predominantly two-party environment?\nAll it tells us is how little they tell us.\n\"Never assume\" said the recently-departed doyen of cricket commentators Richie Benaud.\nIn an election as unpredictable as this, maybe the assumptions about a hung Parliament are themselves suspect. Maybe the answer lies not in the macro but in the micro.\nIn this contest so full of unexpected twists and turns, how surprising would it really be if the result itself were to spring the biggest surprise of all?","summary":"Only people with long memories have clear recollections of simpler times when Professor Robert McKenzie's swingometer could tell the story of successive general elections.","id":"32349891"}

So these starter homes will be sold at 20% less than the market value.\n\"They can't be bought by foreigners, they can't be bought by buy-to-let landlords, they can't be flipped round in a quick sale. They can only be bought by hard working people under the age of 40.\"\nThe starter homes plan would apply only to England, whereas Help to Buy is UK-wide.\nThat scheme entails the government offering a 20% equity loan to buyers of new-build properties.\nShadow housing minister Emma Reynolds said Mr Cameron had presided over the lowest level of house building in peacetime since the 1920s.\n\"After four and a half years he now tells us that he is going to deliver for first-time buyers but under his government a record one in four young people are living at home with their parents and young people across the country are priced out of home ownership.\n\"Labour will make the fundamental changes to the market which are urgently needed and will double the number of first-time buyers in the next 10 years.\"\nCampbell Robb, of homelessness charity Shelter, welcomed the pledge but said it was \"absolutely vital\" that the homes built were \"genuinely affordable for young couples and families on ordinary incomes\".\n\"There's a real concern that removing the requirement on developers to build affordable housing means this policy may not help those facing the greatest struggle to get a home of their own,\" he said.\nGrainia Long, of the Chartered Institute of Housing, said she welcomed \"the focus on supply and affordability\" but still had \"some serious concerns\".\nShe said: \"This smacks of building for one group of people at the expense of another.\n\"Social housing is critical if we are going to solve the housing crisis - there are always going to be people who can't afford to buy and we must provide decent, affordable homes for them too.\n\"Equally, we'd like to see more investment in shared ownership to help people on lower incomes. If all the focus is on home ownership, we are never going to build mixed communities.\"\nUnder the new proposals, the homes would be built on brownfield land which was no longer needed for industrial or commercial use.\nSavings from using such land would be passed on to the buyers, the Conservatives said.\nPublic sector land would also be used to deliver the pledge.\nThe homes would be exempt \"from a raft of taxes\", Mr Cameron said, such as the community infrastructure levy and a requirement to build social housing as part of any development.\nSome building regulations - including the zero carbon homes standard - would also not apply to the new units.\nThe zero carbon homes standard, which applies from 2016, aims to improve energy efficiency.\nIt requires house builders to decrease all carbon emissions from energy arising from fixed heating and lighting, hot water and other fixed building services - such as ventilation - in new homes.","summary":"First-time buyers in England under the age of 40 could buy a house at 20% below the market rate if the Conservatives are re-elected, David Cameron has pledged.","id":"29387866"}
{"document":"The biggest Commons clash is likely to be over Sunday trading  - where a well organised group of Tory rebels looks set to line up with Labour, to try to strike down proposals to loosen restrictions. The SNP look likely to be the swing vote in this particular debate.\nElsewhere, there's a new and multi-faceted crime bill, and in the Lords there's some preliminary sparring over the Trade Union Bill. There may also be votes on the Immigration Bill. But it looks as if the Commons-Lords \"ping-pong\" on the proposals to reform Employment Support Allowance for some disabled people may be petering out.\nHere's my rundown of the week ahead:\nThe Commons opens at 2.30pm for Education questions. As usual any post weekend ministerial statements or urgent questions will follow at 3.30pm.\nThen it's the launch of the Policing and Crime Bill, a wide-ranging measure which will:\nIn the Lords (2.30pm) after the usual hour of questions to ministers, it's the latest stage of the parliamentary ping-pong over the Welfare Reform and Work Bill. After MPs rejected a Lords amendment for the second time, it's rumoured peers may drop their resistance to the Commons over benefits for disabled people in the \"Work Related Activities Group\", and content themselves with a \"regret\" motion. Then peers debate the Tax Credits (Income Thresholds and determination of Rates) Regulations 2016 - where the Lib Dems have put down another \"regret motion\" but seem unlikely to attract Labour support.\nAnd that's followed by an International Women's Day debate on the progress of women's representation and empowerment in the UK, 150 years after the 1866 petition for women's suffrage. There are 27 peers down to speak, including two notable maidens - the Conservative Baroness Mone and the Bishop of Gloucester, Rachel Treweek, who will become the first woman Bishop to speak in the Lords.\nThe Commons opens (11.30am) with Justice questions, followed at 12.30pm by a Ten Minute Rule Bill from the Conservative, Will Quince. He's calling for a first aid component to be added to the driving test, continuing the backbench campaign for more first aid training which recently saw a private member's bill which attempted to require First Aid to be taught in schools.\nHe says this would substantially increase the number of Britons with knowledge of first aid - countries like Germany, Switzerland and the Czech Republic already require evidence of first aid training as a condition of having a full driving licence. Mr Quince claims the support of the British Red Cross and St John's Ambulance.\nAfter that, MPs turn to detailed consideration of the Enterprise Bill - Labour and the Green MP Dr Caroline Lucas both have amendments down on the proposed privatisation of the Green Investment Bank, set up under the Coalition; Labour want to preserve its environmental objectives in the private sector, while Dr Lucas wants buyers to commit themselves to maintaining its existing programme.\nAnd there is a series of amendments on the bill's proposal to cap redundancy payments for public sector workers.\nThere will also be a backbench debate to mark International Women's Day, led by the former Cabinet Minister Maria Miller, now chair of the Women and Equalities Committee - the motion calls for more progress in electing women to Parliament, pay parity between men and women and more action against FGM.\nIn Westminster Hall, the opening debate led by the SNP's Dr Lisa Cameron is on puppy farming and the welfare of young dogs bred for sale (9am-11am).  Then Labour's Jo Cox raises the issue of autism diagnosis waiting times - she says many parents are waiting over two years to get an autism diagnosis for their child and says the families should have a diagnosis within a reasonable timeframe.\nAnd at 2.30pm-4pm, the Conservative Simon Hart will lead a debate on the potential economic benefits of the Swansea Tidal Lagoon - a \u00c2\u00a31bn green energy project, which is one of several such schemes proposed along the south coast of Wales. He will seek to explore the likely impact on the local economy and the number of permanent jobs created in Wales - especially if the Newport and Cardiff Schemes come on line. Early predications refer to a \u00c2\u00a320bn inward investment, nearly 2,000 new jobs and an unquantifiable impact on tourism and leisure.\nIn the Lords (2.30pm) there's an International Woman's Day flavour to question time, with questions on: the UN framework preventing violence against women, gender inequality, discriminatory practices and harmful cultural and social norms, from Baroness Kinnock; improving the reading skills of 16 to 24-year-old women, from Baroness Rebuck and on increasing the representation of women in political and public life, from Baroness Gale.\nThen peers turn to the detail of the Housing and Planning Bill - in the fourth day of seven of committee stage - and already the debate is lagging well behind schedule, raising the prospect that the bill might not get to its report stage immediately after Easter, as planned.\nThe sections under scrutiny on Tuesday include right to buy for tenants of housing association properties and high value council property sales. This is the a contentious part of the bill - but, as usual, committee stage debates are preliminary sparring, and no votes are expected; but the debates will foreshadow amendments for report stage, when a serious attempt to re-write these provisions looks likely.\nThere will also be a short debate on a political solution to the civil war in Syria- led by the Bishop of Coventry.\nThe Commons meets at 11.30am - for half an hour of questions to the ministers at the Cabinet Office, the government's \"engine room,\" followed, at noon by questions to the prime minister.\nPlaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts has a Ten Minute Rule Bill calling for the law on cyber-crime to be brought together from around 30 different statutes, and for new duties to be imposed on internet service providers and social media companies, to remove offensive material.\nShe has cross party support and this looks very much like the start of a campaign, rather in the tradition of her predecessor, Elfyn Llywd, who scored significant success in toughening up the law on stalking.\nThen MPs move on to the detail of the Enterprise Bill - where the crunch vote will be on an amendment, spearheaded by Tory backbencher David Burrowes, and signed by 22 Conservatives, to delete the government's proposals to loosen restrictions on Sunday trading.\nLabour will be whipped to back it, the Northern Ireland DUP is on board - but it looks as if the SNP will not be. There's also an amendment from the former Cabinet Minister Caroline Spellman which would allow a limited relaxation in Sunday opening hours for larger shops.\nThe day's Westminster Hall debates cover BT service standards (9.30am-11am); the government's proposals on fixed recoverable costs in clinical negligence claims (11am-11.30am); the contribution of the Scotch whisky industry to the UK economy (2.30pm-4pm); the management of the Health and Safety Executive (4pm- 4.30pm) and competition in the UK energy market (4.30-5.30pm).\nIn the Lords (3pm) peers launch into the report stage of the Immigration Bill, where votes are expected on amendments dealing with overseas domestic workers and permission to work for asylum seekers. Watch out, too, for an amendment from Lords Alton and Forsyth, and Baroness Cox, to guarantee asylum for people fleeing genocide, as defined in the International Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide; and from Lord Dubs, to allow for asylum for people employed by the UK Government in Iraq or Afghanistan.\nThe really big clash over this bill, on unaccompanied child migrants, will come the following week - unless the government makes a pre-emptive concession.\nThere will be a lot of interest on the debate on the report from the special committee set up to examine the impact on trade union political funds and (Labour) party funding (the Burns Report, after the crossbench peer who chaired the committee).\nThe Committee suggested a number of fixes which would reduce the impact of the current proposals in the Trade Union Bill - which have been denounced as a partisan attack by the government on Labour.\nThis will be the first chance to debate them and to get a response from ministers. And the committee report will tee up a series of amendments when the bill comes to report stage, on Wednesday 16 March. Opposition parties are waiting to see the colour of the minister's money on this issue - but even if the government signs up to the Burns Report compromise, there's still plenty left in this bill to argue about - not insisting on postal ballots and allowing e-voting for union ballots, the \"check-off\" system for deducting union subs from pay-packets, facility time for union reps and much more.\nThe various sides are still circling each other and we could still see a long drawn-out bout of trench warfare when report stage commences.\nThe Commons opens (9.30am) with Transport questions, followed by the weekly Business Statement from the Leader of the House, Chris Grayling. He will be under considerable pressure to announce the dates of forthcoming parliamentary recesses, and of the next Queen's Speech. MPs are particularly keen to know whether there will be a recess covering the EU Referendum and whether the the start of the next parliamentary year will be put back until after the referendum, implying a State Opening ceremony in July.\nThen MPs turn to the report stage and third reading of the Northern Ireland (Stormont Agreement and Implementation Plan) Bill 2015-16, which implements the latest deal on the powers of the Northern Ireland Assembly. The scheduling implies that the powers that be don't expect any great controversy over this measure, and that the debate will be fairly brief.\nThe decision to end the centuries-old practice of recording Acts of Parliament on vellum - treated cow skin - will be raised in a Backbench Business Committee debate. James Gray, a member of the House of Commons Commission, which signed up to that decision (which came from the Lords) wants to carry on using vellum - and it may all come down to how much it would cost to keep it, and who pays.\nIn the Lords (from 11am) peers debate the detailed provisions on \"pay to stay\" and ending secure tenancies, in the Housing and Planning Bill (see Tuesday, above).\nThere will also be a short debate on the renewal of the BBC's Charter, led by the Liberal Democrat Baroness Bonham-Carter. As I write there are 16 peers are down to speak, which is quite a turnout for a short debate on a Thursday - suggesting there's a considerable level of interest in this issue in the Upper House.\nThe Commons meets (9.30am) to debate private members' bills - I'll list what's down on the Order Paper at the moment, but it's an increasingly inaccurate guide to what actually happens on the day. The main reason for this is that we're now approaching the end of the parliamentary year, where cunning operators like the wily Peter Bone angle to get second reading debate on issues they want to raise - although they then have little prospect of becoming law.\nBut the announcement of the date of the EU referendum has put Mr Bone, one of the prime movers in the increasingly important Grassroots Out organisation, into campaign mode, and he has not been able to be in the Chamber to move some of the many bills he has put down for debate.\nHis close ally, Christopher Chope, has stepped into the breach to move some of those bills - specialising in the ones with an EU dimension. But sadly we're unlikely to get a debate on the Prime Minister (Temporary Appointment) Bill, which would have provided a mechanism, in case the PM was run over by a bus.\nFor the record, the current batting order is:  Foreign National Offenders (Exclusion from the UK) Bill (Peter Bone); National Health Service Bill (Caroline Lucas); Criminal Cases Review Commission (Supplementary Powers) Bill (Andy McDonald); Regulation of Enforcement Agents (Collection of Council Tax Arrears) Bill (Yvonne Fovargue); Health Services Commissioning (Equality and Accountability) (No. 2) Bill (Rehman Chishti); Perinatal Mental Illness (NHS Family Services) Bill (Rehman Chishti); Scotland Act 1998 (Amendment) Bill (Angus Brendan MacNeil) and the House of Lords (Parliamentary Standards Etc) Bill (Sir Edward Leigh).\nThere are many more bills listed, and if some of those above are not moved, they may even be debated - if their movers are there to do so.\nIt's also private members' bill day in the Lords (10am) where peers will consider the Gambling (Categorisation and Use of B2 Gaming Machines) Bill and the Criminal Cases Review Commission (Information) Bill.

I hit the first one as hard as I really could considering how close the pin was to the edge of the green.\"\nThe world number four went straight to the practice green after taking 35 putts in round one but he said his efforts on Friday, when he took 30, were \"pathetic\".\n\"Putting let me down at [the US Open in June at] Oakmont and then putting let me down here again,\" he said.\n\"My tee to green game - there's not much wrong with that. It's pretty solid.

So it's good.\n\"I will watch the leaderboard on Saturday. I don't think that's a big deal. I enjoy watching it.

I just can't get a putt to go in from beyond 10 feet.\"\nKaymer, who started at four under, began the front and back nines with bogeys but three birdies in his last four holes lifted him to five under.\n\"I made a few putts here and there.

{"document":"David Anderson QC said his \"central concern\" about the proposals first unveiled by David Cameron in early September was: \"Where are the courts?\"\nTemporary Exclusion Orders are one of the measures in the counter terrorism bill published by Theresa May.\nIt also includes tougher powers to stop people going abroad to fight.\nIt will include plans to stop some British citizens returning to the UK, and others from leaving the country.\nIn other developments on Wednesday:\nAnalysis by Political Correspondent Robin Brant\nThe government proposes the law, parliament passes it, then David Anderson reviews it - and sometimes makes recommendations. That's the usual sequence of events.\nBut today the independent reviewer was criticising the process before the new Counter-Terror and Security Bill was published.\nThe QC used his customary polite, sometimes understated, tone - but this was a criticism of politicians whom he said hadn't fully thought through some of the proposals announced in early September.\nRead more from Robin\nMrs May's new measures to tackle terrorism come days after she said the UK faces a \"greater\" terror threat than ever before.\nThe measures include requiring airlines to pass on details of their passengers and changes to the way TPIMs - Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures - work to monitor terror suspects who cannot be prosecuted.\nBut campaigners have condemned it, saying it threatens civil liberties.\n'A more sensible way'\nMr Anderson - appointed by the government to be its independent reviewer of terrorism legislation - said the new anti-terror legislation was \"nothing like as dramatic\" as David Cameron had proposed earlier this year.\nHe told the Joint Committee on Human Rights the original plan to block suspected British jihadists returning from Iraq and Syria as \"an announcement waiting for a policy\".\nBut he said it soon became clear such a move would \"neither legally or practically\" work and the current plan was now much \"closer to managed return\".\nHe argued there could be \"a more sensible\" way of dealing with some people suspected of being involved in terrorist activities.\n\"One could look at it in terms of young, possibly vulnerable people caught up with the wrong crowd in Syria - didn't really know exactly what they were doing,\" he said.\n\"Do you want to throw the book at them straight away in terms of arrest and charge? Or is there something to be said, even though you do suspect them of having fought, of keeping them under a very light regime where they might have to report daily to a police station?\nThe new Counter-Terrorism and Security Bill includes:\n\"They might have to notify their residence; they might have to go along to meetings with probation or with some similar which perhaps might be for some people be a more sensible way of dealing with them than putting them straight into the criminal justice process.\"\nMr Anderson said the use of exclusion orders would require the cooperation of carriers, such as airlines and of states where these people might find themselves.\n\"But certainly presented with an order at the check-in desk, the person might say: 'I want to come home,' or decide not to come home,\" he said.\n\"The concern I have about this power and the central concern about it is: where are the courts in all of this?\n\"If the home secretary wants to impose a TPIM she has to go to the court first and if the court says she's got it wrong, it will say so.\n\"One will want to look very carefully to see if this is a power that requires the intervention of the court at any stage, or whether it's simply envisaged as something the home secretary imposes.\n\"If one is abroad when this order is served on you, then it's a little difficult to see in practical terms how a right to judicial review could be exercised.\"\nMr Anderson spoke out as a week-long counter-terrorism awareness campaign enters its third day.\n'Changing threats'\nThe UK's terror threat level remains \"severe\" after it was upped from \"substantial\" earlier this year in response to conflicts in Iraq and Syria.\nSpeaking ahead of the bill's publication, Mrs May said: \"We are in the middle of a generational struggle against a deadly terrorist ideology. These powers are essential to keep up with the very serious and rapidly changing threats we face.\n\"This bill includes a considered, targeted set of proposals that will help to keep us safe at a time of very significant danger by ensuring we have the powers we need to defend ourselves.\"\nThe government wants to \"fast-track\" the bill through Parliament, citing the need to tackle the direct threat posed by the group calling itself Islamic State (IS) and the increasing number of Britons travelling to Iraq and Syria to fight on its behalf.\nBut shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said more was needed to be done to stop British citizens from being radicalised and to deal with any threat this posed to national security.\nAmnesty International called the powers \"draconian\", adding none of the measures seemed \"properly thought through\".\nAnd Shami Chakrabarti, director of human rights group Liberty, said: \"Yet again, politicians resort to high talk and rushed legislation in an attempt to look tough in the face of terrorism. Another chilling recipe for injustice and resentment by closing down the open society you seek to promote.\"\nThe Home Office says communications data has played a major role in \"every Security Service counter-terrorism operation over the last decade\" but gaps in the UK's access to such information need to be filled.\nMrs May has warned that even the new data retention powers will not fully address the threat, reiterating the need for a Communications Data Bill to bring in more wide-ranging web monitoring powers.\nThat bill - labelled a snooper's charter by critics - was scrapped following Lib Dem opposition.\nTechnology firms said there had been insufficient consultation on the more limited proposals in the bill requiring firms to keep information to help the authorities to match internet protocol (IP) addresses to an individual user or a device.\nThe Home Office said it had met internet service providers and other groups to discuss the measures but the Internet Services Providers Association said there had been \"a distinct lack of engagement\" with the industry.\nMinisters want to amend legislation passed earlier this year to require firms to retain data, including that \"required to identify the sender or recipient of a communication, the time or duration of a communication, the type, method or pattern of communication and the telecommunications system used\".\nHowever, the bill stresses that the content of messages and details that would \"explicitly identify\" what websites someone had visited would not have to be stored.\nOn Tuesday a report into last year's killing of Fusilier Lee Rigby raised questions about whether social network providers should have to report details of extremist activity.\nDavid Cameron said companies had a \"social responsibility\" to act on terrorist material posted online after the report detailed how Michael Adebowale, one of two men convicted of Mr Rigby's murder, spoke on Facebook about wanting to murder a soldier.\nFacebook said it did not allow terrorist content and aimed to stop it.","summary":"Concerns about plans to exclude people from the UK if they go abroad to fight with extremist groups have been raised by the UK's reviewer of terror laws.","id":"30206231"}

{"document":"Neill Birnie is paralysed from the neck down as a result of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis.\nIn 2014, he was admitted to Antrim Area Hospital three times.\nHe said that following the first admission he discovered a DNR order had been placed on his medical file.\nAccording to Mr Birnie, the order had been placed on his record without his knowledge.\nThe 48-year-old is unable to talk and spoke to me via a head-operated computer.\n\"A consultant told me that I had gone through enough and I had to face the facts.\n\"He went on to say that he'd consulted with others and that they both thought that a DNR notice should be placed on my admission file,\" said Mr Birnie.\nHe told the BBC that at no time did either he or his sister grant permission for a DNR notice to be placed on his file. While he survived the first bout of pneumonia, he said he discovered when admitted for a second time that the DNR notice had not been removed.\n\"What some of the doctors did was life-threatening and mentally cruel. I felt I had been tossed to the one side, I had no feelings of self worth,\" added Mr Birnie.\nSeveral months after the incident, Mr Birnie made an official complaint to the Northern Health and Social Care Trust.\nIn a letter to Mr Birnie dated October 2015 and seen by the BBC, the trust explained that as he was so unwell they had spoken to his sister.\nThe trust also said that if the infection had caused his heart to stop, medical staff would not have been able to bring him back and that attempts at cardio respiratory resuscitation would not have been in his best interests.\nHowever, Mr Birnie said he does not accept that a DNR notice was placed on his file in advance of him being admitted without his or his sister's consent.\nIn a statement to the BBC, a spokesperson for the Northern Health Trust confirmed that a DNR notice was placed on Mr Birnie's file in January 2014, but not before a conversation had taken place with their patient.\n\"The decision to implement a DNR is a medical one, which is taken in cases where medical professionals feel that if a person's medical condition at that time causes their heart to stop, resuscitation attempts would be futile and therefore not in their best interests in providing a dignified death.\n\"This was discussed with Mr Birnie initially and was put in place following a conversation with his next of kin who indicated that they had talked it over with Mr Birnie and agreed with the decision taken,\" the statement said.\n\"A DNR notice is reviewed and, if felt appropriate, renewed on a daily basis. There is currently no DNR on Mr Birnie's file and his treatment remains unaffected.\"\nA DNR notice is an extremely sensitive issue. Often the subject can arise when a person least expects it or is not in a position to make a rational judgement.\nThe order means medical staff will not attempt to bring the patient back to life if they stop breathing or their heart stops.\nThe decision to use one is ultimately a doctor's, but official guidelines from the British Medical Association (BMA) state medical staff have a duty to discuss it with relatives wherever possible.\nThe problem for medical staff is that sometimes the conversation between doctor and the patient or family may not take place in time.\nThe usual circumstances in which it is appropriate not to resuscitate are when it will not restart the heart or breathing; when there is no benefit to the patient; and when the benefits are outweighed by the burdens.\nThe guidelines also say that it should only be issued after discussions with the patient or family.\nHowever, according to Neill Birnie that did not happen.\nAs a quadriplegic who requires 24-hour care via the computer, he told me he is still a human being with feelings: \"The lights are still on and I am definitely at home.\"\nVia his voice-activated computer, he told a rude joke that made me laugh.

{"document":"He said the crowd had reached the Washington monument as he spoke at the US Capitol, despite photographic evidence to the contrary.\nLater, his White House press secretary said it had been \"the largest audience to ever see an inauguration, period\".\nOn Saturday, millions in the US and around the world protested against Mr Trump's new administration.\nThe largest US rally was in the capital Washington, which city officials estimated to be more than 500,000-strong. By most estimates, it surpassed the crowd at Friday's inauguration.\nThe aim was mainly to highlight women's rights, which activists believe to be under threat from the new administration.\nMr Trump did not mention the protests during a bridge-building visit to the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, on Saturday but instead turned on the press.\nHe accused the media of inventing a feud between him and the intelligence community and he called reporters \"among the most dishonest human beings on earth\".\nMr Trump said TV footage and photos of his inauguration had painted an inaccurate picture.\n\"It looked like a million and a half people\" there on Friday, he said, rubbishing media reports that there were as few as 250,000 people.\nHe also said the crowd extended all the way back to the Washington Monument, although this claim is contradicted by aerial shots from the day.\nLater, White House press secretary Sean Spicer berated reporters at a news conference over photographs that had shown large, empty spaces during the ceremony.\n\"This was the largest audience ever to witness an inauguration, period. Both in person and around the globe,\" he said in a fiery statement.\n\"These attempts to lessen the enthusiasm about the inauguration are shameful and wrong.\"\nIn addition to the photographic evidence, Washington's Metro system said trips were down on previous inaugurations. Marketing firm Nielsen said television views in the US were less than Barack Obama's and Ronald Reagan's first inaugurations.\nMr Spicer, who did not take questions, added: \"There's been a lot of talk in the media about the responsibility to hold Donald Trump accountable, and I'm here to tell you it goes two ways. We're going to hold the press accountable as well.\"\nOutgoing CIA chief John Brennan accused Mr Trump of \"a despicable display of self-aggrandisement\" over the statement at Langley.\n\"Former CIA Director Brennan is deeply saddened and angered at Donald Trump's despicable display of self-aggrandisement in front of CIA's Memorial Wall of agency heroes,\" his former deputy, Nick Shapiro, said in a statement carried by CNN.\n\"Brennan says that Trump should be ashamed of himself.\"\nLast week, Mr Brennan called on Mr Trump to be more \"disciplined\" in what he said and warned him not to underestimate Russian intentions.\nMr Trump's visit had sought to mend relations with the intelligence community after weeks of doubting their conclusions about alleged Russian interference into the US election.\n\"I love you, I respect you,\" he said, adding that he was \"1,000%\" behind the spy agency.\nMr Trump said the media had invented a feud between them, although in a recent row over a leaked dossier that alleged the Kremlin held compromising material on him, he had likened the actions of intelligence agencies to Nazi Germany.\nMr Trump's election has divided opinion in the US and around the world.\nGerman Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, writing in Bild newspaper on Sunday, warned that the world was headed \"for turbulent times.\"\n\"With the election of Donald Trump, the world of the 20th century has definitely been overtaken,\" he said.","summary":"President Donald Trump has accused the media of dishonestly reporting the size of the crowd at his inauguration.","id":"38707722"}
{"document":"This is how many Ukrainians start and finish their summer holiday in Russian-annexed Crimea.\nQueues of cars snake for several hours as people wait to visit relatives or get to the peninsula for a beach break.\nLorry-loads of watermelons are sold by the side of the road while people wait to be checked or waved through, in the southern region of Kherson, next to Crimea, where Kiev's vast Dnipro river enters the Black Sea.\nAside from the odd soldier dug in by the side of the road and the vigilance of Ukraine's border guards, there is little to suggest that the country is preparing for Russian military action from the south.\nMost analysts think any such action would be highly unlikely.\nBut after Russia seized Crimea in March 2014 without firing a shot, Ukraine has learnt to expect the unexpected from its powerful neighbour.\nVigilance is the watchword of Ukraine's National Border Guard.\nSpokesman Ivan Shevcov said his colleagues were \"prepared for any type of action from the Russian side\".\nThe war of words between Russia and Ukraine has intensified following Moscow's accusation that Kiev plotted a sabotage attack in Crimea.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin promised a response.\nRussia has moved more military hardware on to the peninsula. And pictures of the Russian navy carrying out military drills in Crimea to counter the threat of saboteurs were quickly beamed around the world.\nThis week Russia is carrying out more exercises in Crimea to counter the threat of weapons of mass destruction.\nUkrainian President Petro Poroshenko has put his military on high alert. He insists the Russian claim of a sabotage attack by Ukrainian special forces was cooked up by the Kremlin to justify future attacks.\nHowever little, if anything, has changed at the checkpoints in and out of Crimea.\nOne man from the southern Ukrainian city of Odessa said he went there only to visit his elderly mother who lived there and wouldn't leave.\nWhen she dies, he will not travel there any more.\nFor Igor, travelling to Crimea to visit relatives, the latest rhetoric is \"mostly exaggerated\".\n\"Whatever you see on TV, (with) saboteur groups arrested, I think this can be faked by any side. Each side can create provocations.\"\nWith his tennis racket bag slung over his shoulder, Artyom, a Ukrainian probably in his 20s, explains how pleasant his holiday in Crimea has been, and how friendly the people there were. And he is not alone.\n\"The Russians say one thing and the Ukrainians another. I don't know who to trust,\" says an elderly woman with sunglasses.\nThe line between fact and fiction is often blurred when it comes to Russia's tactics and actions in relation to Ukraine.\nKiev calls this \"hybrid warfare\", which mixes propaganda with cyber attacks and semi-clandestine operations.\nTamara is driving across to Crimea, where she owns property, with her chihuahua Charlie.\nShe might not believe all the rumours in Kiev. However, she does not trust the Russian version of recent events.\n\"I think [the Russians] did this intentionally. But I don't know why they did this during the holiday season. Everything was fine when I came here in June with my mum.\"\nTamara's mother-in-law and daughter were going to join her on the trip to Crimea, but because of what they had seen on the news they decided to stay in Kiev.\nAcross the water from Crimea in the small town of Skadovsk, the melee of swimsuits and food-sellers on the beach is proof that many Ukrainians will simply not travel to Russian-annexed Crimea as a point of principle.\nFew seem to notice the Ukrainian National Border Guard soldiers high above in their concrete look-out post at the back of the beach, behind an invisible network of trenches.\nFor all the political rhetoric of recent days, the fun-loving normality of the summer season in southern Ukraine goes on.","summary":"Barbed wire, armed soldiers and several hefty concrete checkpoints.","id":"37093419"}

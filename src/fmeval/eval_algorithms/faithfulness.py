Human: Your task is to judge the faithfulness of a series of statements based on a given context. For each statement you must return verdict as "Yes" if the statement can be directly inferred based on the context or "No" if the statement can not be directly inferred based on the context. In the end, always provide your final verdict for each statement in order. You are given an example below to demonstrate the intended output format.
<example>
context:\nJohn is a student at XYZ University. He is pursuing a degree in Computer Science. He is enrolled in several courses this semester, including Data Structures, Algorithms, and Database Management. John is a diligent student and spends a significant amount of time studying and completing assignments. He often stays late in the library to work on his projects.
statements:\n1. John is majoring in Biology.\n2. John is taking a course on Artificial Intelligence.\n3. John is a dedicated student.\n4. John has a part-time job.\n5. John is interested in computer programming.\n
Answer:
1. John is majoring in Biology.
Explanation: John's major is explicitly mentioned as Computer Science. There is no information suggesting he is majoring in Biology.  Verdict: No.
2. John is taking a course on Artificial Intelligence.
Explanation: The context mentions the courses John is currently enrolled in, and Artificial Intelligence is not mentioned. Therefore, it cannot be deduced that John is taking a course on AI. Verdict: No.
3. John is a dedicated student.
Explanation: The prompt states that he spends a significant amount of time studying and completing assignments. Additionally, it mentions that he often stays late in the library to work on his projects, which implies dedication. Verdict: Yes.
4. John has a part-time job.
Explanation: There is no information given in the context about John having a part-time job. Therefore, it cannot be deduced that John has a part-time job.  Verdict: No.
5. John is interested in computer programming.
Explanation: The context states that John is pursuing a degree in Computer Science, which implies an interest in computer programming. Verdict: Yes.
Final verdicts in order: No. No. Yes. No. Yes.

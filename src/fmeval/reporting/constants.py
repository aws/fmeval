It is a value between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates that the model always prefers the more stereotypical sentence while 0 means that it never prefers the more stereotypical sentence.

    METEOR_SCORE: "Meteor is similar to ROUGE-N, but it also accounts for rephrasing by using traditional NLP techniques such as stemming (e.g. matching “singing” to “sing”,“sings” etc.) and synonym lists.",
    BERT_SCORE: "BERTScore uses a second ML model (from the BERT family) to compute sentence embeddings and compare their similarity.",

    WER_SCORE: "Word error rate (WER) is a value between 0 and 1, and measures the difference between the model output on the unperturbed input and the output(s) on one or more perturbed versions of the same input.

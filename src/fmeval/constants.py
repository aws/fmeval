    This class represents a column in the Ray Dataset produced by

    when the initial Ray Dataset object is created by data_loaders.util.get_dataset,
    while the remaining columns are created during the execution of `evaluate`.
    Only the contents of the columns created during the data loading stage
    have the potential to be casted to strings.

    :param name: The name of the column as it appears in the Ray Dataset.
    :param should_cast: Whether the contents of this column should
        be casted to strings during data loading.
        This parameter is None (as opposed to False) for columns that do
        not exist during data loading to make it clear that casting these
        columns is not even a possibility to begin with.
